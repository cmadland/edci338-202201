## Demographics {-} 

### Target Audience and Users {-}

 TikTok is available in over 150 countries, storing the information of over 1 billion users. The widespread population of users has approximately 120 million users residing in the United States, 87 million from Indonesia and 72 million in Brazil. Surprisingly, Canada does not currently make the shortlist of countries (top 10), that hold the greatest number of users. Owed to the increase of technological advancement, it is evident why the main demographic of consumers is what is commonly referred to as the “Gen Z”. A totalled 60% of users match Gen Z’s age group (individuals born between the years of 1997-2012) with a majority aged between 10-25 (Wallaroo, 2022.). With that being said, it should be noted that TikTok requires its users to meet the minimum age requirement of 13 years old. 
 An older demographic of seniors can be seen on this app too, though they constitute an unusual subset. Similar success has been recorded of older generations, with great traction and activity on their platforms. To name a few, oldgays is a group of older men that share their thoughts and opinions on life, and cookingwithLynja shares insight on how to make yummy meals in a quick and easy fashion. 
 In comparing the gender of TikTok’s users, there is an obvious breakdown of genders and their active use on the app. To date, identified females make up the majority of users with a remainder of male users (39%) and others (2%) constituting the rest. TikTok targets individuals with interests and hobbies of all sorts. Promising a guarantee for users to be matched with creators that align with their hobbies and interests, running from fashion to baking, dance and/ or travel. 
 Tiktok has enabled users to create business accounts to allow for easy, accessible and reviewal of the accounts analytics. Businesses in particular have greatly utilized the analytics page to pinpoint the age, gender, and likes of their active users. The information received from the analytics, successfully supplies and equips companies with the proper tools to adapt and  progress.

#### Non-users {-}

TikTok does not require users to create an account to browse the platform. There are a variety of methods that allow non-users to navigte the platform. With a few simple steps, users that do not wish make an account are able to view the content. 
The first option consists of following three simple steps:
1. Go to TikTok.com  
2. Select “For you” on the left sidebar   
3. Begin watching videos without logging into an account  

Videos made and created on TikTok’s platform can also be viewed on other neighbouring media platforms. Multiple channels on youtube have dedicated their content to uploading what is currently trending on TikTok. Content creators of youtube make it possible for users without an account to gain quick and easy access to like and comment on the video on youtube. 
TikTok videos may also be viewed without an account if they’re sent by message, Snapchat, email, Facebook etc. 
With that being said, there are a variety of features that can not be accessed by users without an account. Guest users features are restricted and they are unable to follow creators, like videos, see or write comments on the videos, upload or share content or join creators ‘lives’.

#### How Users are Connected {-}

TikTok features allow users to generate communities online. Users can stay connected through the act of sharing, following, commenting or liking other creators’ posts. Simply by locating and following a creator’s account, their videos will be readily available for viewing in the “following” section of TikTok. Unless the creator’s content is made private, a user does not need to wait for access to be granted, in order to proceed in viewing the video of the account. Furthermore, there are no obligations for users to follow one another back, however, access to the creator’s videos is still made available regardless of mutual following. 
 There exists two types of pages to view content. The ‘for you page’ showcases viral TikToks and creators of all sorts. This side of TikTok may allow users to discover new creators they wish to connect with or follow. After the user has followed the creator, their content may now exist on the other side of TikTok. 
 Separated into two sections, the videos published by the users following will appear on the ‘following’ page, while other creators will appear on the “for you page”. The users following page exists to serve individuals with accessible access to their favourite content creators and avoid missing out on their friend’s and families’ posts.
 Another way to interact on TikTok is to engage in creators’ “lives”. Users may choose to go live to interact with their followers in real-time. By sharing insight into their daily living, creators have found great success expanding their followers and creating user engagement. Another unique feature allows for creators to go live with other fellow creators on the app. TikTok lives provide users with access to comment, ask questions and send or receive gifts. Although, TikTok requires users to meet a following of 1,000 and be 16 years of age in order to host a live. 


### Content {-}

#### Content Sharing {-}

On TikTok, users have the ability to share any post they see on their feed. In order to share a video, users must tap the arrow located in the bottom right hand corner. Once the user has clicked the share arrow, a variety of methods to share are displayed. These options include the ability to share the video through copying the link or sharing it on another social media platform such as Snapchat, Messages, Facebook messenger or Instagram.  

![share](assets/tiktok/share.jpg)

#### Privately Sharing Content {-}

When a user initially creates a TikTok account, the videos and comments are set to be public. This means any TikTok user can access the content and follow the account. However, TikTok does have Privacy settings that allow the account to be changed to private. When the account is set to private, the account holder can approve or deny follow requests and only their approved followers can view the content. 

Even if the account is set to public, the account holder has access to edit the privacy settings on individual videos. These privacy settings allow users to allow everyone access, only the followers that users follow back, or only the account holder to view the video.

![content](assets/tiktok/content.jpg) 

#### Viral Content {-} 

Content published on TikTok has the ability to go viral any time a user creates and uploads a public video onto their account. If the content a user creates gets picked up by the TikTok algorithm, it will be shared to other users via the “For You” page. Based on the user's interests and past interactions with TikTok videos, the platforms analytics curates a "For You" page of video content from creators the user may not follow. The algorithm utilizes users’ data on interactions with videos such as the screen time of watching a video, liking the video, and/or sharing it.

![foryou](assets/tiktok/foryou.jpg) 

Once the video makes it to the “For You” page, it has the opportunity to go viral. As a video receives more comments, likes, shares, and duets, the greater its chances are of being picked up by the algorithm. The completion rate of a users’ videos is an additional factor that influences ranking. In short, the more a video is liked and fully watched, the greater it’s chances are of going viral.

### Business Details {-}

#### Private Parent Company {-}

The founder, Chairman and former CEO Zhang Yiming created ByteDance in 2012 and developed the video sharing app TikTok aswell. ByteDance, Tiktok's parent company, is based in Beijing, storing the information of over a billion users worldwide. As the name implies a parent company serves to control the interests of another company. The parent company is privately owned by a Chinese tech company, with no opportunities for other interested parties to buy in. 

#### Major Investors {-}

Despite the main ownership of TikTok being owned by the Beijing-based tech company commonly referred to as “ByteDance”, in recent years pressure by the Trump Administration forced Bytedance to expand and create a new company referred to as TikTok Global.  These steps allowed Americans to feel safe about the storing and gathering of their citizen’s information, as opposed to China potentially using it to gain insight and track Americans. To date, the current minority owners are Oracle and Walmart. Oracle holds a 12.5% stake in the company, with Walmart at 7.5%.

#### Revenue Generated {-} 

The business model of leading social media apps are quite similar to one another and lead to the generation of profits. While TikTok is free to download, the network does exceptionally well from paid advertisements and in-app-purchases. Scrolling through the “for-you” page, embedded in-feed ads will begin on auto-play. Tiktok will direct ads based on the user’s interactiveness with certain content. This is very helpful for businesses to grow, network and generate profits, however, the current cost of in-feed ads start at a minimum of $10 per Cost Per thousand/ mile views (CPM). Furthermore, there also exists brand-takeover ads, which begin to play an ad from the moment the app is launched. Businesses may prefer to buy into these ads, to grab the attention of their target audience while they are most attentive. To view ads, a more prestigious form of advertising consists of longer adds up to 60 seconds that pop up during the duration of a user’s activity on the app. Branded hashtag challenges also exist to create brand awareness. The hashtag appears on the discovery page as a fun way to boost user engagement and get messages across. Lastly, branded effects offered by TikTok allow businesses to purchase custom stickers or filters that can be used by users on TikTok for a period of 10 days. As for in-app purchases, TikTok has utilized virtual coins to be purchased and shared among its users. Ranging from 100 to 10,000 virtual coins, the price can vary between 99 cents- $99.99. The in-app currency allows users to show appreciation for the content they engage in and enjoy!

## Privacy and Surveillance {-}

### TikToks ToS and Privacy Policy {-} 

[Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service?lang=en)
[Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-row?lang=en)
[Privacy Policy for Younger Users](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-for-younger-users?lang=en)

### Key Takeaway's from TikToks Privacy Policy {-}
The Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy (PP) serve as a legally binding contract between TikTok and its users. Confined within this document is advanced terminology that the average person would find difficult to comprehend. A crucial point stated in the document notes that Tiktok is not held accountable for the privacy policy of third-party partnerships and advertisements that are provided in the app via Cookies (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 20). Following that, Tiktok is also not liable if the user is to click a link outside or from a Third-party source (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 37). 

 Under the section 'User Content and Behavioural Information' TikTok explains that by giving informed consent, the app may collect users’ information present in their content including their background, face, location and bodily attributes. They also disclose information that may be obtained regarding your interests, gender, and age as means to “personalize” content and "[promote] your content to other users and explore whether your profile presents further opportunities for collaboration" (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 10).

 With reference to the Privacy Policy for Younger Users (YUPP), the document was substantially shorter than that of the General Privacy Policy (GPP). The Policy states that limited information is obtained from youth under the age of 13 residing in the United States (US).  This includes the username, password, date of birth, device ID, IP address, web browser type and some app activity (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 1-2 ). This information is only acquired for troubleshooting and other analytical services. In addition, this is also collected for legal and governmental reasons which not only is rare but is reasonable as it is law enforcement. (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 4 & 6). An apparent difference found between the YUPP and GPP resides in the difference of protection between users. Those who are 13 and under are subject to much less severe policies and are inclined to more privacy. In contrast, those who are over the age of 14 are forced to forgo their privacy and grant TikTok access to a great deal of their personal information. 

 Users should be encouraged to review the Policy Acts laid out by TikTok, in order to be fully made aware of and comfortable with their decision to sacrifice their privacy rights. TikTok recommends that any questions or concerns with respect to the ToS or PP be directly addressed to them via email (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 34).

## Social Media and PLN in Education {-}

![How to Like](assets/tiktok/img3.JPG)

When a user likes the content produced by a content creator, the like is viewed by the person who made the video. However, it should be noted that unless settings are switched to be private, the video can be viewed by all. Attached below are numerical steps to be followed if one wishes to switch their “like history” to not be viewed by others.

### Creators {-}

#### Educators on TikTok {-}

Educators use TikTok as a platform to reach audience members from all over the world. TikTok provides a platform for creators to share their voices and knowledge. Videos are created with the intent to educate viewers, answer questions and promote learning. All types of content are currently being taught on TikTok. Educators such as Dad, how do I? provides valuable life lessons and educates viewers on how to fix things. Users can also access Janelle Rohner's content which educates viewers on Keto lifestyles and provides weight loss tips. Depending on the type of content the creators produce, this determines the type of audience members. For instance, Dad, how do I? has an audience of mostly young people while Janelle Rohner’s audience is an older audience as some of the content she shares is keto drinks for those 19+. No matter the topic of interest, there is sure to be a content creator producing educational content on that particular topic.

#### Educators Response to Comments and Questions {-}

A majority of creators prioritize replying and addressing questions made by their audience to create engagement and provide continstency. Comments can directly be responded to in a video, and is often done so by creators. When a question has been asked, educators may produce a video that shows the question being asked and them addressing it. This way, they can directly address the comments and/or questions of their viewers.  An example of this is shown below. 

#### TikTok as a PLN {-}

Educators on TikTok are able to use the platform as a Personal Learning Network (PLN). For instance, TikTok provides educators with a space to share and utilize worksheets, assignments and activities that fellow teachers have created. The growth of TikTok has allowed it to beome a virtual team to distribute and swap ideas. The app can be a great tool for teacher to expand their personal learning networks and gain insight on useful methods employed by teacher alike.

### Educational Post on TikTok Experience {-}

An educational video that instructs users with numerical steps to create “vegan ceviche” was created and posted by all group members. Provided is a link, published by one of the 3 persona accounts on TikTok:
https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiagreen111/video/7077332572879015173?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1  

Tiktoks platform allows for users to create, distribute and share educational videos, 15-60 seconds in length. Added features such as voice overs, make it easier for users to record first, and explain after. In addition, education is not only limited to users viewing the videos content, but rather it continues when users engage in the comment section. This gives the creator the  opportunity to respond and interact with their audience, and demonstrate consistency.

In reviewing the responses to the TikTok published on all three persona accounts, there were no significant differences. The amount of views received fluctuated between all 3 personas ranged from 76 to 805 views. Despite the seemingly high number of  viewers, all 3 accounts fell between 3-7 likes. Sophia Green, persona created to reflect a social justice seeker, received the most views and likes on her platform. By incorporating popular hashtags in the caption section, she was able to generate a bigger audience. 
By using hashtags such as vegan or sustainable, it has the potential to be seen by over 19.3 billion users that have already keyed that search. The imlemtation of hashtags is not a new concept, but rather it is used as an extremely effective approach by influencers, artists and creators alike to generate a bigger followings. In the same manner, Lindsay Adams took advantage of hashtags by adding ones such as #healthy living, #yogasnacks, #vegan and #fuelyourbody. The use of these popular hashtags most likely played a contributing role to help TikTok place this video onto the ‘for you pages’ of individuals whose interest and previously liked videos were in line with the hashtags used. 

With all this being said, it is clear by TikTok’s analytics, that each account must employ tips and tricks made by fellow creators to grow in likes, comments and follows within their platform. For future educational posts, success may be found in making use of more popular hashtags and trending hashtags. In addition, staying up to date with trending sounds and dances is an important and useful way to keep users engaged. 

### Concerns with TikTok {-}

As with any social media platform, educators should be aware of the inappropriate content that can be accessed on the app. The most obvious sources of adult content on TikTok are profanity and suggestive clothing. Although the minimum age for a TikTok user is 13 years old, the app does not use any age verification tools when users are creating an account. With the ability to search any hashtag or keywords in the app, users can access any content created by another user. Although TikTok has strict guidelines on nudity and graphic content, since any user can upload their opinions on any topic, offensive content may be shared on the app. Due to the nature of the social media app, when a video becomes viral millions of people can be impacted by ampliganda. According to DiRestas, ampliganda is the new word for misinformation in the digital age. On TikTok, any user can now shape perceptions and realities by having their ideology amplified through shares, likes, and comments of a mass audience.

### Other Things a Curious Educator May Want to Know {-}

A curious educator should know that TikTok is meant to help empower them. When an educator joins TikTok they are given a platform separate from their institution which often limits and controls what they are able to do and say. TikTok is created to help anyone share their voice and find an audience to share it with. There are so many educators who join TikTok and use it as an extenion of their classroom. However, unlike in a classroom, on TikTok there is not a limited number of seats to teach. Instead, there is an entire world of individuals you have the ability to educate and impact. 

Pre pandemic, educators perhaps would have viewed social media apps as a distraction to their students. Nevertheless, amidst the global pandemic where times have never been more uncertain, TikTok offers educators a platform to post educational videos which may help students learn online. Educators have the opportunity to utilize TikTok as a mini classroom in which they can post shortened condensed video lessons for students who may have missed a class or for students who may benefit from a refresher on the class. Social media apps have gained such popularity and rather than punishing students for using them, educators should hop on the trend and use them to their benefit to appeal to their students. 

## Balancing Your PLN and Public Discourse {-}

### High Profile Individuals {-}

Social media has provided an outlet for celebrities and high-profile individuals the opportunity to provide direct insight into their daily lives. It serves as a safer means for celebrities to interact with their following and allows for immediate answers to trending news. Tiktok is an excellent example, of a social media platform that allows for easy, direct communication between a celebrity and their following. Celebrities employ the features on the app to generate loyalty with their fans and boost their following. Their humanistic traits allow celebrities to be just as susceptible to making mistakes. Social media allows high-profile individuals the ability to share their stances on political or personal matters, and apologize for their shortcomings. Their personal platform allows for fans alike to comment, like and show support. In order to stay in the public eye, it is crucial that high-profile individuals are consistent and make time for posting, going live, or even replying to comments. The current apps that surface to date allow for friends and families to stay connected, despite geographical separation. Celebrities share similarily to the general population, with the desire to connect in the same fashion. Brand, movie or music deals, often require high-profile individuals to create awareness and promote the upcoming release dates of finished products. Tate Mcrae, a Canadian songwriter, singer and dancer utilizes her TikTok platform to promote her world tour and release of new songs. Posting short clips of her music before the release date encourages fans to pre-save her music and anticipate the album’s release.  It is evident that social media provides high-profile individuals with accessible tools to promote growth, interaction and connection with targetted audiences. During elections, many running candidates have made use of their social media accounts to interact, respond and address public concerns. Tiktok has allowed candidates to secure young voters and provide users with information to allow for educated voting at the polls. US senator of Georgia Jon Ossoff, who goes by @jon on TikTok, used his platform to campaign for his election against Republican David Perude. With all this being said, it is clear that social media has provided a welcoming space for high-profile and notable individuals to progress.

### Benefits of Being in the Public Eye on TikTok & Having a PLN {-}

Personal learning networks provide a welcoming space for the formation of global communities. Worldwide users are able to tap into the broad wealth of knowledge while taking a special interest in their personal area of focus. In recent years, personal learning networks have closed the gap of keeping users up to date with global news, updated ideas and trends. Without a presence in the public eye, one may not be equipped with the everchanging realm of education that exists in today’s societal context. Becoming a user on the social network gives direct and accessible access to the building of relationships, sharing of expertise, staying educated and staying in contact with friends and family. Visibility also remains a primary benefit to the continued engagement in social media. Users that take pride in their presence on social media through pushing and engagement in content will reak the benefits, and may become a name that others rely on for information. For example, NDP leader [Jagmeet Singh] (https://www.tiktok.com/@thejagmeetsingh?lang=en)  has benefited tremendously from being on TikTok. He is in the public eye constantly on the news, however, he has been able to be in the eye of a younger audience through his presence on TikTok. Being that the younger generations have the lowest voting count in history, his TikToks have been able to encourage higher voter turnout. His Personal learning networks are notoriously known for their value in providing a third-person perspective on ones practice(s). Furthermore, they serve to build an open community of learners, that engage by choice and are free from limitations.

### Employers Limiting Factors, Restrictions and Benefits {-}

The review of users who have high profiles outside of the TikTok Platform resulted in the location of Doritos’ TikTok page. Considering Doritos is a popular brand and has a high following on TikTok, they're a perfect example of a user on the platform who is not only TikTok famous. The person who creates videos for Doritos’ TikTok page is restricted in the kind of content they can publish, as it must be “brand-friendly”. Due to the apps ability to share and gain opinions and stories, as well as the ability to see the behind-the-scenes of strangers' lives, TikTok has gained a lot of traction over the last few years. However, in creating content for a popular brand like Doritos, there are limitations in sharing controversial opinions as the brand does not want the public to “cancel” them. Although users’ who share relatable content on Tiktok can become famous, that fame can easily be taken away if the public deemed their content offensive. Nevertheless, if the videos Doritos posts on TikTok gains a lot of views, it is great advertising for the company and can potentially gain new buyers. 

### Reliability {-}

Personal learning networks allow for individuals to interact and create online learning communities, despite geographical differences. For this reason, it becomes of paramount importance that users pinpoint their education needs, in order to locate a suitable audience and collaborators that suffice desirable learning outcomes. An area of difficulty that remains, is the possibility of falsified information. To ensure a reliable PLN is created one must be considerate of the information they’re reviewing. When reading an article it is essential to be skeptical of the information, even if something is presented as a fact this does not instantly certify that it is. Education that provides users with tools to determine validity, serves as a great educational tool that can be used to investigate information being displayed. The purpose of online learning networks is to challenge different points of view by utilizing a platform to interact with fellow users. To only engage with posts that align with personal beliefs or ideas, defeats the purpose of continued growth and understanding. Leading by demonstration is a commonly referred to saying, for it serves great success in creating an unspoken standard that exists in all areas of focus. By becoming a leading example, users will likely follow suit and partake in regular online activity, the sharing of viable resources and give consistent effort. 

### Minimizing Misinformation {-}

There are a variety of reasons for which misinformation is shared. People may share it because they believe it to be true or, they may be sharing the misinformation for entertainment or sarcastic purposes. Veteran storytellers are able to minimize the risk of sharing misinformation by holding themselves accountable and adhering to TikToks community guidelines. The policies outlined work to prevent misleading, harmful and or deceptive accounts off of TikTok and eliminate the spread of misinformation (Pappas, 2020). Within the guidelines, it states that all information with the potential to cause harm to a community or larger population is prohibited. As a means to help dilute the amount of misinformation being spread, TikTok has entered into an agreement with third-party apps to provide “fact checks” of the content that has been created on their platform (Pasquetto et al., 2020). Although fact-checking is not able to eliminate misinformation entirely, it provides an excellent way to diminish misinformation. Alongside fact-checking, there also is a subset of users who have taken it upon themselves to help stop the spread of misinformation. The video enlisted below received significant praise and remains a highly recommended resource to all users that utilize platforms as a means to share and accumulate knowledge. https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/how-tiktok-creators-are-tackling-misinformation-111242821989

In this video, a creator on TikTok delves into her experience counteracting the prevalence of misinformation and racism on another user’s platform. Critical solutions are in high demand, pushing for the help of governments, special interest groups and platform creators. Despite the current use of fact-checking, community guidelines and user accountability, there is yet to be a viable solution to completely eradicate misinformation altogether.

## Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy {-}

### Digital Identity {-}

In recent decades, generations have become more technologically adept, increasing the number of hours spent sharing, liking and posting on social media. The social network holds over 4.62 million users, with 424 million new users joining in the last 12 months. The growing numbers are proof that users consistenly utilize the features offered on the plethora of social media platforms avaliabe. Further analysis of users profiles that compare the apparent difference between personal and professional identities allow for users to recognize personal traces left behind on social media sites. 

The visitor and resident map was a valuable tool to map out our groups presence on social media and learn from it. Learners can make use of V&R mapping to assist in the visualization of trends on the internet by the user (White & Cornu, 2011) . As a guide, the horizontal axis shows where social media activity can be placed in relation to the resident side (left) or the visitor side (right). By following the vertical axis, social media activity can be placed near the personal side (top) or institutional side (bottom). Creating a collective group map encompassing each members social media use facilitated intellectual discussion as we compared our personal, institutional, visitor and residence placements to one anothers. Collectively agreeing that we used TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and VSCO on a day-to-day basis. This activity allowed us to become well aware of the trace we leave on social media platforms. Our placement of different web tools in the quadrants led us to notice that our twitter and personal email (residential use) began as personal but gradually became more institutional as the semester progressed. We were able to identify UVIC’s email platform to strictly be used for professional purposes only. With no communication between friends and family, it remains a hub that is only visited. The placement of TikTok caused great grief amongst our group. Accordingly, we deciced to create two separate categories that would include our school persona (Ariel Fipke, Lindsay Adams, Sophia Green) and our individual personal accounts. With countless hours spent on TikTok, it was fitting that it was placed in the middle right quadrant, to showcase the personal use spent on the apps platform. Continued time spent liking, commenting, and sharing of videos, allows for TikTok to monitor and collect personal content preferences in accordance with its users. In contrast, the persona accounts created in this course were placed in the bottom right hand quadrant. Despite, our daily login use on our personal persona accounts, it was used to satisfy school (institutional) requirements, rather than personal.

### Media Literacy, Trust and Disinformation {-}

TikTok has many moderation policies in effect which are constantly evolving and changing to suit the needs of their growing platform. There are community guidelines set in place to establish set norms and a code of conduct to which all users must adhere to. Any content which violates the community guidelines is removed by TikTok. Additionally, accounts or users who engage in severe or repetitive violations of the platform are temporarily banned or removed altogether. Within the community guidelines, there are rules in effect to protect minor safety and action is taken against any behaviour which constitutes sexual exploitation of minors, grooming behaviours, nudity and sexual activity of minors, harmful activities of minors, crimes against minors etc. The moderation policies also exclude any behaviour which promotes, normalizes or glorifies dangerous acts and challenges including suicide, self-harm and disordered eating. TikTok does not condone, bullying or harassment, adult nudity and sexual activities, violent extremism, hateful behaviour, impersonation or misinformation of any sort. (Tiktok. February, 2022.) When a user creates an account on TikTok they sign an agreement to follow these community guidelines. However, if they are not followed further actions are taken. TikTok will either themselves remove the content, or other TikTok users may report any content they believe does not fit within community guidelines.

In addition to the removal of TikTok videos that share in the spread of misinformation, fact-checkers also serve to combat the prevalence and spread of misinformation on the app. Fact-checkers aren’t able to verify the entirety of the information present in the video published. For this reason, it becomes of great importance that Tiktok has now decided to flag all videos that the fact-checkers were inconclusive on. Each video that has been flagged will appear as follows (Perez, 2021.):

If the user decides to still share the video despite being given a pre-warning about the potential misinformation they are sharing, TikTok may intervene and the video will become ineligible for promotion on the “For You Page.” TikTok also works to provide trusted links to the TikTok community. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an in-app notice was introduced so when hashtags related to the pandemic were searched by users, links to World Healths Organizations’ websites were provided so that users could see trusted information. They also expanded on this by creating an information hub in-app as means to continue to provide the TikTok community with an abundance of resources related to accurate and trusted resources (Tiktok, 2022.).   

Despite the many efforts TikTok has put fourth in attempt to combat misinformation, fact checkers effectiveness remain a point of concern with it’s funding directly stemming from the app itself. In Jim Lukes blog post “that’s no plagiarism detector” ^[Luke, / J. (2019, March 13). That's no plagiarism Checker. EconProph.(https://econproph.com/2019/03/12/thats-no-plagiarism-checker/ )]it discusses the true intentions behind the online plagiarism detector, formily known as Turnitin. This article, with reason, prompts others to reevaluate TikTok’s fact checkers validity and be questioned in the same way. Turnitin, a company which was meant to eliminate plagiarism in the school system also served the purpose of helping institutions save money by robotically grading student papers, reducing the amount of required faculty members. As stated in Miah Armitage’s Wow and Wonder Week 8 Post^[Armitage, M. (2022, March 8). Wow and wonder week 8. Miah338. (https://miaharmitage.opened.ca/2022/03/08/wow-and-wonder-week-8/)], she was “utterly shocked to learn the intentions behind Turnitin.”  Being that a plagiarism checker is being payed to do much more than simply detect plagiarism, it causes a question to circulate around the authenticity of fact checkers and whether they are doing more than they claim.  It can also be hard to believe that TikTok fact checkers have pure intentions strictly meant to eliminate misinformation when there are many testimonials from TikTok creators who have been banned or shadow banned on the platform when they have not violated the guidelines in any way.

Misinformation and disinformation will never entirely go away. Social media platforms have taken steps to curb the prevalence, though further assistance is required of its users to evaluate information before sharing. Education serves an important role in building familiarity with misinformation techniques, to allow users to recognize misinformation posts and avoid engaging in or sharing. Another important step is to become aware of personal biases, as research has shown vulnerability directly related to the confirmation of one’s own pre-existing bias. TikTok recognizes that despite the multitude of benefits its platform offers, it can also be used as an easy outlet for both misinformation and disinformation to spread. The app has promised to combat the appearance of these untrustworthy sources by introducing a new feature that would highlight the unreliability of unverified content, thereby slowing its spread throughout the app (Stokel-Walker, 2021). In the case that a video is published without the chance for a TikTok moderator to review and fact check the video, a message will appear. This banner will cross the screen stating that the video may contain unconfirmed content (Stokel-Walker, 2021). In addition, if the user attempted to share the video, another message would appear to remind the user of the unverified content in the video and ask to confirm their willingness to proceed and share it. This additional feature has shown great success with a 24% decrease in users sharing unverified content, after being reminded of its questionable validity (Stokel-Walker, 2021).
