### Platform Utilization & Platform Interaction {-}
Educators, or creators, are able to use Youtube to strike up interesting discussions as well as share knowledge for the desired targeted niche. They may do so by uploading videos to their created profile, or ‘youtube channel’, in which users will be able to access and view their videos at the time of convenience. The types of videos uploaded will depend on the target audience of the educator. For example, [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOrganicChemistryTutor/featured) uploads tutorial videos on organic chemistry, general chemistry, physics, algebra, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus—his primary audience, in turn, consists of users related to these subjects, most of which are high school students. In other cases, there are educators such as Michelle Emerson’s [“Pocketful of Primary”](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf4ktrnK_jWG1mC7U7fNphA) who help fellow teachers lead a healthy teaching lifestyle by sharing ideas on classroom management, lesson planning, and building student relationships. The possibilities are endless and ultimately, it is up to the educator to determine the content they would like to publish. 

Youtube can be utilized as a personal learning network. Besides creating content, Youtube can help foster connections, maintain connections with relevant groups, and also allow for new learning. Each educator will have a unique following, where he or she will be able to interact with their community through a variety of methods. The most common form of interaction are comments—should educators feel the need to respond to a user, they are free to leave a comment. The following are a few other methods of how people interact on Youtube:

**1. Comments**

### Platform Concerns (Privacy, Age-inappropriate Content, Disinformation, etc.) {-}
Educators should be careful of distracting, harmful, and inaccurate videos that are published worldwide across the platform. Youtube’s content is generally not well-vetted, meaning that there is no requirement for published information to be accurate or truthful. In other words, creators and users do not have restrictions on what’s being said or shown through comments or videos ^[[Youtube is major conduit of fake news, factcheckers say](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/youtube-is-major-conduit-of-fake-news-factcheckers-say)]. As a result, viewers can easily fall prey to misinformation and disinformation. Violent or sexual content can also be a significant concern. Despite Youtube’s community guidelines, sensitive content still tends to get past regulations.

Fortunately, the platform has resources which enforces reporting and filtering of content such as the following:
