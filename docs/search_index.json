Click the link to the current week in the ToC to navigate to the current updates. Week One (Jan 10-16) Hello everyone and thank you for joining this course! My name is Colin Madland and I will be your instructor for this Spring 2022 cohort of EDCI 338, Social Media and Personalized Learning. I am a PhD candidate in the Educational Technology area of the Faculty of Education, where I am researching assessment in higher education. You can learn more about me and my research on my personal website and follow me on Twitter. I live and work in West Kelowna, BC, on the traditional, unceded, ancestral lands of the syilx people and I am grateful to be a guest here. When I am not working on my reasearch, or my day-job at another BC university, I really enjoy riding my bicycle, cooking all sorts of deliciousness on my grill, and hanging out with my family, which includes my wife, 2 two sons, 1 daughter-in-law, 1 daughter, 1 son-in-law, and 1 grandson. Some people might include the fur-bearing beasts (a dog and a cat) in the ‚Äòfamily‚Äô category, I know they certainly do! I‚Äôm going to be honest with you (hopefully that isn‚Äôt surprising‚Ä¶) and perhaps a bit vulnerable. I‚Äôm teaching EDCI338 for the first time this spring, and the course requires a significant investment in learning to use some technologies that you and I both may not be entirely familiar with. There aren‚Äôt really any good ways to think deeply about social media without actually engaging in social media. That can be really challenging, especially in the midst of the ongoing dispruption of our lives due to COVID-19. Disruption can take many forms, from being physically sick with COVID, to having family members and friends being affected, to losing jobs, and on and on. As a result, it can be really hard to focus on learning. So, I want you to understand from the very beginning that it is my *responsibility- in this course to do whatever it is that I can to support your success. üíØ My commitment to you‚Ä¶ I am committed to helping you achieve success in this course, and I trust you to contact me if you have questions or concerns. I hope you will find that you are welcome to approach me through whatever media I‚Äôve published. Admittedly, sometimes I miss notifcations, but that is not on you. I encourage you to be persistent if you haven‚Äôt heard a reply after a day or so. Getting Going During this first week, it will be important to start getting comfortable with a couple of the tools we will use for the course. There is a WordPress Setup and a GitHub Setup page with instructions for how to get started with those two tools. It will be important for you to get started with these tools as they will be critical to your work in the course. I have created a poll to help us decide on a weekly meeting time, but for this week, let‚Äôs meet at 9:00am Pacific time in Zoom at the link that I sent in the announcement from Brightspace Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read the syllabus, which will be posted in Brightspace early this week. ‚úîÔ∏è Sign up for a WordPress site. ‚úîÔ∏è Register for a GitHub account. ‚úîÔ∏è Visit the course repo on Github and create a Learner Profile issue (click Issues to get going‚Ä¶). ‚úîÔ∏è Sign up for hypothes.is and join the edci338 private group. ‚úîÔ∏è Annotate the Course Details and Assessment pages with your questions, comments, concerns, or other observations. Week One - Wednesday, Jan 12 It‚Äôs good to see you starting to register your WordPress sites, signing up for GitHub (BTW, don‚Äôt choose a paid plan!), and submitting your first issue to the ‚ÄòLearner Profiles‚Äô. You can see others who have submitted their issues as well at this link. While you are there, you can click on your own issue and add a label to align yourself with a Learning Pod. Screenshot of adding a label to a Github issue Also, in the EDCI338 repository that you created in your own account, please go to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô, then ‚ÄòManage access‚Äô, and click the green ‚ÄòAdd people‚Äô button and add me as a collaborator to your repository. My GitHub username is cmadland. Since the Learner Profile issues you created in the course repo are public to the course, we will use your own private repository to track your work and have assessment conversations. Manage access to a repository in GitHub. ‚ú® ProTip It is perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed or intimidated at the beginning of a course. EDCI338 has a bunch of front-loaded set up in technologies, and that always takes time. Please be patient with yourself and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you need assistance. Week One Mini Update - Thursday GitHub In the spirit of learning together, I‚Äôve learned that I need to add you as collaborators on the course repository in order for you to use your Learner Profile issues to organize Learning Pods. Those of you who have created your Learner Profiles in GitHub as of 4:45pm on Thursday have been invited as collaborators and should see an email in your inbox with the invitation. Once you are a collaborator, you will be able to add the Learning Pod label to your profile.. Weekend Update 1 ‚Ä¶not that Weekend Update. Happy Saturday, at least I hope it is for you! For those of you in Victoria, stay away from the beaches for a bit until the tsunami warning is lifted! As of this morning, 19 of you have signed up for a GitHub account and created your Learner Profile in the course repository. Thank you for doing that. I know that everyone has different schedules, and in the past, most learners in my online classes do most of the work over the weekend. I anticipate a good number of you will be able to get going today and tomorrow. Just a reminder that you won‚Äôt be able to add the learning pod label to your learner profile until after I have added you as a collaborator in the repo. So far, I have added everyone who has submitted a Learner Profile issue, but there are a few of you who have not accepted that invitation. You can see the invitation if you sign in to Github and visit the course repo. There will be a blue notice towards the top of the page. As I mentioned previously, it really is important to get a good start becoming familiar with the technologies we will be using this term. Technology is a significant part of the *content- of this course, not just the medium for communication. If you are having challenges, please reach out to me as soon as possible! I‚Äôve published in Brightspace (look in the Content navigator) a link you can use to book an appointment. I encourage you to book as a learning pod or as an individual. Good to see several of you annotating the course book using Hypothes.is! While you are welcome to post publicly, I have created a private group for EDCI338 if you would prefer to use that. Check out ‚ÄòThings to do this week‚Äô. You will notice that there are several points in the course book where the text is highlighted, as below: hypothes.is annotations These are annotations using hypothes.is and you can access the tool by clicking the little arrow in the top right corner of the course book. hypothes.is access Then when the overlay opens, you‚Äôll be able to sign in or sign up to annotate the page. Hypothes.is is active throughout the book, so you can use it to ask questions about any page‚Ä¶even this one. If you do that, then answers to your questions will ba available to the whole class. Wins all around! üïê Class Meeting Times The class meeting time poll has closed and the most popular time (8 votes out of 14 people who voted) was 1:00pm on Fridays - Click to see a time Zone Converter . I usually like to meet earlier in the week, but I‚Äôm happy to fit the course schedule and rhythm to what works for most of you. Please let me know if you or your learning pod need to connect! I‚Äôm happy to make time for you. I‚Äôll end with this‚Ä¶ JodyVance on Twitter Direct Link Have a good weekend! Week Two (Jan 17-23) Thank you all for your work over this first week to get started with both WordPress and GitHub, and a bit of hypothes.is. Over the next couple days, I will get your blog links and feeds set up on the course hub so that you‚Äôll be able to find each others‚Äô thoughts and reflections. I have sent invitations to everyone who has submitted a Learner Profile issue on the course repository. If you haven‚Äôt yet completed that task, please do so as soon as possible this week to ensure you can join a Learning Pod. This week, we will begin looking at, thinking about, talking about and reflecting on what it means to be a participant in this ‚Äúgnarly hairball‚Äù, as danah boyd writes, of a digital culture we live in. We are interconnected in ways that we neither recognize nor give assent to, yet there are those who argue that we can use these same connections to derive significant relational value with other people. Social media is evolving tremendously rapidly (TikTok is only 5 years old and is already forcing YouTube and Instagram to change their approaches), and in many ways, careful thought about the implications of all this has not been at the forefront. We will think a bit about the importance of both building a network of allies and also the challenges of TMI (too much information). Week 2 Readings To get started, here are four articles and blog posts you should read: What is a Personal Learning Network? What are Personal Learning Networks? Understanding Personal Learning Networks Networked Privacy Please read these articles and then engage in some thinking in light of them during the following activities: Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read the four articles above. ‚úîÔ∏è Individually, use this Canva template, (or download the Venn Diagram image below, or draw your own) to think about how and why you participate in networked public spaces (the bottom-left circle), and how those ideas interact with your offline life (bottom-right circle), and with some other sphere of your life (top circle). You do not need to publish this, although you are welcome to, so the intent is to get you thinking about how the various circles of influence in your life interact, overlap, or maybe conflict. ‚úîÔ∏è Meet with your learning pod, ideally before the class meeting on Friday (1:00 Pacific Time) to discuss any questions you had about the readings or the Venn diagram activity. Feel free also to connect with each other about what social media tools you are particularly interested in. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your first Wow and Wonder post on your WordPress blog. Make sure that your blog link is in your Learner Profile issue on the course repo and that you use the category edci338. ‚úîÔ∏è Meet in the course Zoom link (published in Brightspace) on Friday at 1:00 pm, Pacific time. Downloadable Venn Diagram Template Weekend Update 2 Welcome to the weekend! I trust that you will be productive, unplugged, connected to support, rested, or whatever you need in whatever measure you require. It was good to meet with about a third of you on Friday at 1:00 Pacific time. We were able to connect on some questions and get some more detail about using GitHub to manage your work in this course. Fortunately, I remembered to record the shareable parts of the meeting and post the recording to Brightspace under ‚ÄòZoom Recordings‚Äô. Feel free to have a look. There are a few of you who have joined from the waitlist in the last few days, so welcome to you! It will be important for you to review the updates from Week 1 in order to catch up to others in the class. Please let me know if you have questions! Hopefully, by the end of tomorrow (Sunday) you will have read the four articles listed under Week 2 Readings and met with your Learning Pod to discuss the readings, the Venn diagram activity, or any technical questions you might have so far. üí≠ Remember It is critical for you to stay in contact with either me or your Learning Pod or both if you are having difficulties! I recognize that there is a heavy technology lift at the beginning of this course, but I am confident that you can learn the workflow. It will be important for all of you to have completed all of the technology set-up tasks in GitHub and WordPress as we will be using GitHub more next week. Week Three (Jan 24 - 30) In Week 3, we are going to dive a bit more deeply into thinking about how you choose to present yourself in digital spaces, where you have control over that, and what you might do to regain control where it is lacking. Hopefully you recall the goals of the course, which include you being able to explain personalized learning and its relation to learning theory, and recognize that the Internet is not a neutral or equal space for everyone. You also should recall that your culminating post for this course, your Celebration of Learning, will require you to demonstrate how you have met each of the outcomes for the course. As such, it‚Äôs not too early to get started on your Celebration of Learning post as a draft on your site. Agency When you have the freedom and ability to take some specific action, it is often said that you have agency in that action. Unfortunately, in life, education, and social media, we sometimes lack agency. Compliance Tweet Link to Tweet Part of what I hope you will gain or develop in this course is a greater sense of agency over your interactions in digital spaces, whether they be networked and public, or not, and especially with respect to the technologies you might want or be required to use for your university education. Networked learning spaces have presented challenges for traditional models of university education, which has grown out of a long and very stable tradition that prioritizes lectures and the transmission of knowledge from the expert to the novice. Contrary to the transmission model, a networked model prioritizes the interactions between nodes in the network as the work of learning happens. In 2005, George Siemens wrote an influential article in which he outlined a vision of a learning theory for a networked time, which he called connectivism. One key argument in the theory of connectivism is that knowledge resides not only in individuals, but in the connections between individuals and that knowledge can be accessed through interactions between them. This is why this course is structured the way it is. By having you work in Learning Pods, rather than as individuals, and having you reference each other‚Äôs posts, it is intended that you will begin to realize the creation of a networked community. Further, by using GitHub and WordPress, which are both designed with features that enable and encourage lasting connections, rather than Brightspace, which is designed for short-term connections (at best), I hope that you, as a collective, will build a productive and supportive community of learners. Safety and Equity As a cis-gendered straight white male, I recognize that, if life were a video game (it‚Äôs not, and I don‚Äôt mean to trivialize the very real challenges we all face), I would be playing the game on the easiest level. I would have all the cheat codes, my challenges would be eminently attainable, and I would be able to breeze through the game with relative ease and comfort. Others, however, such as members of the LGBTQ+ community, Black or Indigenous people, disabled people, women and especially people who live at the intersection of more than one of those communities are all ‚Äòplaying‚Äô under far more challenging conditions, especially online. As such, many open source software communities have adopted community codes of conduct to ensure that all people have equitable opportunities to participate and contribute to the knowledge of the community. As the open education community has emerged from the open source software community, we too have adopted this practice. In the context of EDCI338, we are going to use this week to consider our own Code of Conduct. To do so, we will start to use the capabilities of GitHub a little more deeply. In GitHub, you can go to the ‚ÄòInsights‚Äô tab, and then choose ‚ÄòNetwork‚Äô, where you will see a Network graph, as below (it will be a bit different when you see it as I will have committed changes since then). Github Network Graph In the graph, you can see that there are two ‚Äòbranches‚Äô in the repository. A repository begins with only one branch, called main, but users can create branches, or copies, of the main branch in order to test features in the software, or ideas in the course, as it may be. You can see that this repository has two branches, the main branch (white, on the top), and a second branch called dev (green, on the bottom). The white line that drops down from main to dev on Jan 22 is when I merged the two branches by pushing changes I had made in main (the white dots) to dev so that the two branches were the same. I did this through a process called a pull request, or PR. By the time you see these instructions, I will have pushed changes from main to dev again, but dev will be ahead of main because I will have made changes on dev and started a pull request. The PR is the suggested addition of a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct I am suggesting is based on (or forked from) other open source codes, but it doesn‚Äôt quite fit for application in a course (I think). Our primary task for this week will be to review the pull request and come to a decision (maybe a consensus, maybe not) about how to proceed. We might choose to revise the code, accept it as is, or create a completely new one‚Ä¶but we shouldn‚Äôt proceed without one. To see the pull request, sign in to Github and click the ‚ÄòPull requests‚Äô tab in the menu just below the title of the repository. You will see that there will be one open pull request for you to click on. Once in the PR interface, you will be able to scroll down the page to see an overview of the proposed changes. You can get a more detailed view if you click ‚ÄòFiles changed‚Äô, which will show you a split view of the old file on the left, with deletions in red, and the new file on the right, with additions in green. GitHub Split Screen View of Proposed Changes In the split view, you can hover over one of the lines in the view to see a blue square with a white + sign. Clicking this plus sign will allow you to make a comment about that particular line. On the ‚ÄòConversation‚Äô tab, there is space for a discussion of the PR as a whole at the bottom of the page. Caution The course book at cmadland.github.io/edci338-202201 is being served to the web from the main branch, so it will be important that you follow the instructions below carefully! GitHub Sign in to GitHub. Click ‚ÄòPull requests‚Äô and find the Code of Conduct PR. Click Files changed and read through the proposed Code of Conduct. Leave comments or questions at points that you think we need to clarify, delete, or maybe revise. I have assigned one Reviewer from each Learning Pod who will act as the official approver of the code for that particular learning pod, so make sure you come to some sort of agreement. Leave overall questions and comments on the discussion at the bottom of the Conversation tab. After we have discussed any of the issues you might find, I will merge the PR into the main branch and the code of conduct will come into effect. As always, please make sure you get in touch with me if you are having challenges! Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è All the things from weeks one and two. ‚úîÔ∏è Read the Siemens article. ‚úîÔ∏è Read and comment on the GitHub pull request as described above. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your second Wow and Wonder on your blog. To clarify a bit‚Ä¶this should be a short post that describes one thing that struck you as important (Wow), and one question that you have (Wonder). Your Wow and wonder posts are required but not graded and they should serve as conversation starters in your Learning Pod meetings. ‚úîÔ∏è If you are not yet connected with a Learning Pod or showing on the Blog List page on the course hub, please contact me as soon as possible! Week Four (Jan 31 - Feb 6) Week four already! I trust you are finding your way in this course as we begin to dig more deeply into what it means to build and maintain a PLN and to interact well in social media environments. These first few weeks, we have been building connections in a few different ways: **Asynchronously*- as I publish and you read updates here on the course book site. **Asynchronously*- in Github as I provide some tasks for you and you work to complete those tasks. As of today, everyone should have an invitation to collaborate on the course repository, create a Learner Profile issue, add a label and comment on a pull request. You are welcome to use GitHub to create issues as a group and assign those to me. Doing this will allow the whole class to get answers to common questions rather than those answers being tied up in emails. I have created a ‚Äòquestion‚Äô label that you can add to these issues. **Synchronously*- as we meet in Zoom each Friday at 1:00 PM pacific time to discuss the course. Keep in mind, these meetings are optional and I (usually) record the important parts for your viewing pleasure. **Synchronously*- in your Learning Pods as you meet on your own time and schedule in a smaller group of people. The Learning Pods are intended to be a spot to ask questions of each other, review your wow and wonder posts, and will become your group for building the Major Project. Hopefully, you will begin to realize the beginnings of a PLN within the community of EDCI338. I am often asked by learners who they should follow on social media, and my first recommendation is always that they should follow their classmates as building a PLN among the people you go to school with can be tremendously powerful over the years after you graduate. This week, we look at some issues related to privacy and how that might influence how you choose to share your life and world with web tools. Many people have had the experience of having to click through an End User License Agreement (EULA) in order to use a service. Far- fewer people have actually read what that EULA actually says, and part of that is by design. Those Terms of Service- or EULAs are loooooong and filled with legal language, and much of the most important language is in ALL CAPS, which makes the text much more difficult to read. Digital Privacy It is second nature to most to take selfies and share them on Instagram, Snapchat, etc., but once you move into the role of an educator in either a public or private context, you must adhere to the laws set out by the B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner. Their office has put together guidelines for both public bodies and private bodies. TWU, as a private body is not held to the same standard as public bodies, but we should strive to meet the same standard. The guidelines for public bodies to better understand what the rules are is linked below and how to get consent is detailed on page 4 of the BC Cloud Computing Guidelines (PDF) and you can review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act here.. TWU also has a privacy policy, available here. Each public body will have their own process (which may range from not allowing tools to pressure to integrate networked learning tools from outside of Canada), so it is important to understand your own setting and the law. You may find some administrators or staff breaking these rules or not aware of them. It is important for you to enter your field and uphold the law, regardless of the culture you enter. This does not mean that you do not engage online or outside of Canada. It means that if/when you do so, that you understand the steps, which are not much more complex than the consent you would get normally for going ‚Äúon the Internet,‚Äù as is described in most settings, but you must name the date consent is effective and, if applicable, the date it expires. It is important that you work with your school district on the consent process. You can see an example of how K-12 school districts are addressing access to cloud tools outside of Canada here (Coquitlam) and here plus here (Victoria). You must also name each tool individually. It cannot be ‚Äúblogging.‚Äù You must name WordPress.com or Blogger, etc. If you use Flipgrid, you must name Flipgrid. Consent must also be informed, so effort must be taken to ensure that those signing consent understand the implications ‚Äì that their data may leave Canada, how it may be harvested, and to know about the U.S. Patriot Act. One archived resource by the Canadian Treasury Board provides significant detailed information about the Patriot Act here. It is helpful to also review section 4(b) of the B.C. Digital Literacy Framework which is applicable K12 contexts but helpful for others. Additional resources can be found here: Privacy Education for Kids by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Information Security Awareness by the BC Government MediaSmarts: Canada‚Äôs Centre for Digital and Media Literacy FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Competencies Learners should ensure that they: - Are aware of the OIPC, FIPPA, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines and follow them - Understand what constitutes personal information - Understand that privacy online is a personal choice and must be respected - Understand if that you assume an ‚Äúeducator‚Äù hat, you have a duty for those under your care, their parents and families, and your colleagues with regard to their privacy and protection of personal information - Are aware that the Canadian federal government states that the chances are remote that the US Patriot Act will access personal information of Canadians, but recognizes that it is our responsibility to protect privacy preferences and to ensure that consent obtained is informed consent. Some families may be involved with restraining orders and need to be private for their safety, but the reasons for privacy may be preference. Either way, it is not our business as to the reasons for privacy preferences, but it is our responsibility to uphold preferences. - Understand how media moves through networks into US cloud-based services (e.g., back-ups on iTunes, syncing with Dropbox, messages with personal information is sent on Gmail, Google Docs, blog RSS subscriptions, etc.) - Understand that these acts do not prohibit participation in networked tools outside of Canada and many public bodies are in need of staff and leaders who model networked literacy and positive citizenship online for their community - Understand what appropriate consent looks like for public bodies and is aware of what alternative steps are to support learners when consent is not obtained. Residents and Visitors We will also explore a bit the idea of Visitors- and Residents- in digital spaces. You have likely heard that younger generations are digital natives, while older generations are *digital immigrants- indicating that younger people are totally at ease with technology since they grew up with it, while oder generations have difficulty with technology. I‚Äôd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor- in some web spaces and a resident- in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don‚Äôt leave a public trace of your time there. You don‚Äôt spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving. Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you- reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it‚Äôs any number of social sites like Instagram, TikTok, SnapChat and others. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present*. At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;‚Äì&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;‚Äì&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use. This video explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins). I‚Äôve shared my VR Diagram below‚Ä¶keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there. Visitor-Resident Diagram [OPTIONAL] If you don‚Äôt already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called *Teaching in Higher Ed- by Bonni Stachowiak, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents. Digital Visitors and Residents, with David White - Teaching in Higher Ed Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Complete the Privacy, Ethics &amp; Security in Digital Spaces Developing Awareness of Privacy quiz (not that kind of quiz‚Ä¶). ‚úîÔ∏è Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ‚úîÔ∏è Complete your own *Visitor/Resident- map and share and discuss it with your Learning Pod. You can use the tool that is provided here (DON‚ÄôT forget to screenshot it, or you‚Äôll lose it!), or use a different tool like Canva.com ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your third Wow and Wonder post based on your Visitor/Resident map and what you learned about privacy. ‚úîÔ∏è [Optional] Consider in your Wow and Wonder post what a potential employer might find based on your map if you applied for a job with them. ‚úîÔ∏è Set up a time with your Learning Pod to meet with me sometime this week. Please use the link published in BrightSpace, or submit an issue in Github. ‚úîÔ∏è Looking forward, your first Showcase post, based on one of your Wow and Wonder posts, is due at the end of next week (February 13). Major Project Update Good morning/afternoon/evening! I trust you are all well. This update will provide a mechanism to get you started on the Major Project. As a reminder, the major project is worth 40% of your final grade and will require some sustained effort over the second half of the course. I will be publishing details of the project as it unfolds on the Major Project page starting today. Week Five (February 7-13) Proximity creates empathy. ~Joel In last Friday‚Äôs class meeting (which is now posted in Brightspace), we talked about some of the forces at work in social media platforms and there was good conversation about hegemony, marginalization, and polarization as all being active forces, even though they are often opposing forces (hegemony means that everyone tends towards sameness, while polarization means that two or more groups of people become more and more different from the other groups). As we think about the idea of inclusion this week, I challenge you to consider who is included in your social media circles? Who do you follow or engage with? Who follows you? If the people you follow and the people who follow you are all the same people, and you all think alike, that can be comforting, but you may not be getting a complete picture of life. It can be challenging, yet important, to intentionally engage with people who are not like you. A great example of being intentional about engaging with people who are not like you is Mr.¬†Rogers when he invited Officer Clemmons to share his wading pool in 1969 at a time in the US when most swimming pools were still segregated. Mr.¬†Rogers set an example by inviting a Black man to join him in his wading pool. As you meet with your learning pod this week and talk about inclusion and diversity in your PLN, you might want to consider some of the following questions: How diverse is your existing PLN? In your PLN, are you learning from a variety of voices or are you the loudest in the room? Do you participate in a silo of information sharing (similar themes or wide range of interests)? How can you use a diverse PLN to broaden your views of inclusion? In your professional setting of choice, do you think inclusion is actively embraced? What is the learning outcome of your PLN and how are you ensuring your exposure to diversity and inclusion? How has your thinking about inclusion and PLN evolved after reviewing the videos and readings? Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read Pages 6-12 of One without the other: Stories of unity through diversity and inclusion by Shelley Moore and Leyton Schnellert. The link will require a UVic Library sign-in. ‚úîÔ∏è Watch Shelley Moore: Transforming Inclusive Education ‚úîÔ∏è Watch The Evolution of Inclusion ‚úîÔ∏è Watch a few more of Shelley Moore‚Äôs videos (most of them are 5 mins or less) or listen to some of her podcast interview (also available in her Youtube channel). Follow your interests on this. ‚úîÔ∏è Consider how Shelley uses various social media platforms to share her message and engage with the public. You might want to write a Wow of Wonder about this‚Ä¶ ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your Week 5 Wow and Wonder post. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your first Showcase post. You can base your Showcase post on one of your own Wow and Wonder posts, someone else‚Äôs Wow and Wonder post, or a combination of both. You could even post about something not covered in a Wow and Wonder post. Check the details of the requirements of the post at the link above, and try to get it finished for Sunday, Feb 13. Please let me know if you are having difficulties publishing your post. ‚úîÔ∏è Sign Up to claim a social media platform with your Learning Pod. Instructions are on the Major Project page. Week Six (Feb‚ù§Ô∏è14 - 20) Showcase Posts Thank you to those who have sent links to their first showcase post. You don‚Äôt need to send a link, but it would be helpful if you add the ‚Äòshowcase‚Äô category to your showcase posts so I can easily find them and check to ensure that your blog is linked from the Learner Blogs page on the course hub. Also, please let me know if I need to update anything on that page. Some people have asked about commenting on other peoples‚Äô posts, and yes, you should comment on other peoples‚Äô posts. There are two ways that I recommend doing this. Include an inline link to someone‚Äôs post. For example, if I was wanting to comment on Shaafi‚Äôs Wow and Wonder Post 4, I would just select the text I want to link and click the ‚Äòhyperlink‚Äô tool to add the url of his site, https://shaafij.opened.ca/wow-and-wonder-post-4-week-5-feb-7-feb-13/. Paste the url for Shaafi‚Äôs post on its own line and without hyperlinking it. Normally, this will create an embedded preview in your post. The url will look like this: https://shaafij.opened.ca/wow-and-wonder-post-4-week-5-feb-7-feb-13/ And the preview will look like this in WordPress: Embedded Preview in WordPress Tracking and Feedback To aid in tracking your progress in the course, please complete the following steps in GitHub. In your own GitHub account, create a new private repository called ‚ÄòEDCI338‚Äô (some of you have already done this). Add me as a collaborator to your repository (some of you have also done this). Create an issue in your repository called ‚ÄòTracking‚Äô or something similar with the following copied and pasted into the Description area: - [ ] Wow and Wonder 1 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 2 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 3 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 4 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 5 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 6 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 7 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 8 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 9 - [ ] Showcase 1 - [ ] Showcase 2 - [ ] Major Project - [ ] Celebration of Learning Assign me to the issue. This will create a checklist on the issue that you and I can use to track your progress through the course. Since it is a private repo, it will also be the place where you and I have assessment conversations. Major Project Thank you also to those of you who have signed up for a social media platform to explore for the major project. Just waiting on Learning Pod 6 to sign up. Next steps will be published on the Major Project page tomorrow. Trust and your PLN A friend mentioned to me the other day that she didn‚Äôt know what was true on the internet anymore. It is hard, especially in the context of complex and highly emotionally charged issues (I‚Äôm sure you can think of something in Canada‚Ä¶), to sift through the massive amounts of information that you encounter, even if all that information were to be from trustworthy and reliable sources. Unfortunately, a huge amount of the information we encounter is from distinctly unreliable and untrustworthy sources. The power of social media to connect similar people to each other is both a strength when you are building a PLN, and a hazard when used to drive polarization. Renee DiResta on Twitter has published a good article on how misinformation campaigns are remarkably mundane in how they start and are shared. It really doesn‚Äôt require a sophisticated operation when everyday people will do it all alone. As you read DiResta‚Äôs article in The Atlantic, consider the questions from the syllabus: Building a reputation and trust in a connected culture can be difficult, how are you building a network of individuals who are dynamic, reliable, &amp; participatory. Are you leveraging healthy relationships from your PLN for growth? What strategies do you use to ensure that you aren‚Äôt an unwitting agent of what DiResta calls ‚Äòampliganda‚Äô? GitHub is a social platform focused around collaborating on coding or writing projects. In what ways have you connected with others in the class? Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Compose and publish your first Showcase post, if you haven‚Äôt already. ‚úîÔ∏è Set up a GitHub repository of your own and invite me as a collaborator. ‚úîÔ∏è Create a tracking issue in your own repository and add me as an assignee. ‚úîÔ∏è Read It‚Äôs Not Misinformation. It‚Äôs Amplified Propaganda. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish Wow and Wonder #6 5 on your blog. ‚úîÔ∏è Continue planning for your Major Project. Week Seven (Feb 21-27) We are sliding into the back half of the course, and this week is a chance for you to recharge, catch up, get ahead, and just breathe a bit. This week, I am working my way through providing some comments on your first Showcase posts, so please make sure those are up to date and that you have created a course tracking issue in your own repository. If you are hoping to do some work on your Major project, I‚Äôve published some more instructions on the GitHub Setup page. I‚Äôve described how you can work in a fork of the course repository and also how to upload and add images to your pages (useful for the persona screenshots). I‚Äôm not going to bother you further until Monday, and we will not be meeting on Friday this week, but if you‚Äôd like to book a time to meet with me, I‚Äôm happy to do so. Thursday, Feb 24, 2022 üá®üá¶ üíî üá∫üá¶ Hello, I‚Äôm writing this with a heavy heart. The news out of Ukraine in the last weeks, and especially in the last 24 hours, is distressing, to say the least. As EDCI338 is a course specifically about social media and personal learning networks in education, it would be irresponsible to not mention that there will be a massive social media misinformation campaign coming out of Russia and their allies. Please take care of yourself and what you share. Please remember that there are supports available for you through the UVSS, and you are always welcome to book a time to meet with me to chat. üá®üá¶ üíî üá∫üá¶ Week Eight (Feb 28 - Mar 6) ‚ú® Note I‚Äôve just noticed that the numbering in the syllabus is a bit different from this site. This is Week 8 of the course, and Class 7 in the syllabus. Sorry for the confusion. Prior to reading week, we read about the idea of ampliganda, a term coined by Renee DiResta that captures the fact that misinformation gets amplified in social media and that we sometimes unwittingly become the vector by which it spreads. Little did I know that we would, in the following week, observe a misinformation campaign in such obvious clarity. The Russian embassy in Ottawa posted this tweet to their official account yesterday: Russian Misinformation Campaign I posted a screenshot here so that I‚Äôm not linking to it, which would cause it to be shared more widely. As it is, you can see the tweet was Retweeted 641 times (thie image itself was RT‚Äôd 2600 times) as I‚Äôm writing this. It is extremely difficult to stop ampliganda because of how social media works by encouraging sharing and creating more and more connections. I encourage you to read and follow the advice in this post from Mike Caulfield that covers four ‚Äòmoves‚Äô to help you sort through misinformation. You can also find tools in this Twitter Moment. Surveillance This week, in a bit of a departure from the syllabus, I‚Äôd like you to read, discuss, think, and write about how social media tools of various different types are used to surveil us for profit. In this case, we will take a bit more expansive view of what ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô is in that some of the platforms that come up may not be considered social media by many people, but they rely on the same logic of gathering huge amounts of data from people, aggregating it, and analyzing it to draw inferences based on what the programers determine to be normal. The first platform that falls into this category is TurnItIn (TII), which you may recognize as the tool many universities use to, presumably, detect plagiarism (Note: TII cannot detect plagiarism, and it never has). TII is very much a social platform as it relies on being able to compare the work that you submit to it‚Äôs platform to the work that others submit and the work that others have published on the web. In my other job, where I am the administrator for Moodle, I receive emails from instructors in other universities requesting access to student work that has been flagged as being similar (I always deny their request as that would be an invasion of student privacy and violation of their copyright.) So, the social aspect of TII is completely hidden from you, but it is the key driver of growth for TII. How does TII profit from your data? Good question. Jim Luke, an economics prof in the US, has some thoughts on that. Another similar platform is Proctorio, whose business model is to convince universities that they need to pay Proctorio huge sums of money to require students to install spyware on their computer in order to prevent catch students cheating in exams. This week, you‚Äôll watch some short films on the topic of surveillance in education and society to help you think through the impacts of what Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Make sure you have received my feedback on your first showcase post. Check in your GitHub repository and/or your email for a notification from GitHub. Please be in touch as soon as possible if you haven‚Äôt heard from me. ‚úîÔ∏è Read the posts and articles linked above and scan through the Twitter Moment for resources that you can use. Keep in mind that some resources will be paywalled, don‚Äôt worry about trying to access those, just keep scrolling. ‚úîÔ∏è Watch #tresdancing from the Screeing Surveillance series of short films from Queen‚Äôs University. ‚úîÔ∏è Watch at least one other of the short films from Screening Surveillance. ‚úîÔ∏è Meet and Discuss with your learning pod the topic of surveillance in social media, both the platforms I mention above and the platform that you have chosen for your Major Project. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish Wow and Wonder 6 on your blog based on this week‚Äôs activities. ‚úîÔ∏è Begin collaboratively composing and publishing information about your chosen social media platform for the Major Project. You should have one person in your learning pod who has forked the course repository, and the rest of the people in your learning pod who have forked the fork (fork-ception). You should have published your personas, and this week you can start gathering descriptive data about your platform. I‚Äôll publish more specific details about what to publish today or tomorrow. Week Nine (Mar 7-13) And just like that, we have 4 weeks left in the course! Just a reminder that week nine here corresponds to class 8 on the syllabus HOWEVER we are going to skip class 8 for now and jump to class 9, PLN in Education. I‚Äôm looking at the syllabus and thinking that things have piled up here at the end of the course, so I‚Äôd like to propose that we make an adjustment by dropping the Showcase Post #2 and moving the weight of that assignment to the first showcase, the Major Project, and the Celebration of Learning post. I have created an issue in the course repository where we can discuss this proposal. Please add your voice there. For the remaining four weeks of the course, there will be less of an emphasis on new content and a greater emphasis on you building your components of the Major Project. With that in mind, we turn to one last major topic in the course, and that is thinking about your PLN in the context of education, either formally, such as in EDCI338 or another accredited course experience, or informally, as in when you need to learn how to drive a manual transmission car, or juggle, or cook. Alec Couros is a professor at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan and he is one of the pioneers of the type of open course that EDCI338 emulates in some ways. Couros wrote a book chapter called Developing Personal Learning Networks for Open and Social Learning in which he describes a graduate course he taught in 2008. EC&amp;I 831 had 20 registered participants, but over 200 participants who followed along simply to engage in the community and connect with each other. As you read Couros‚Äô account, there are some things that you may be interested to notice. First are the similarities between the requirements for EDCI338 and EC&amp;I831 in terms of reflective practice combined with collaborative work and using technology. Also, please notice that many of the technological tools Couros writes about are no longer even in existence. Their main course site, wikispaces.com, went out of business several years ago, leaving users very much in a lurch to find alternate homes for their content. Elluminate used to be one of the premiere web conferencing tools, but was purchased by Blackboard, the LMS company, and is now deprecated in favour of Blackboard Collaborate Ultra. Ning.com used to be free, but is now a paid service, so no longer popular for educators. The list goes on. One significant idea that I want you to remember in this, and a reason that I am using GitHub, is that tech platforms come and go, and with them, go their proprietary formats. If a proprietary format can no longer be read, then it is useless. If the platform disappears, your content disappears. Contrary to that, with GitHub, since it reads plain text files, you can take your content with you and deploy it in another platform with only some relatively minor modifications. This idea of being able to take your content with you and deploy it in a different system is called inter-operability, and it is a major concern in the social media landscape today. Think about how challenging it is to download an image from Instagram, or a clip from TikTok without one of those third-party apps (it‚Äôs not just me, is it?). This is evidence that these platforms are not inter-operable; you can‚Äôt easily use content from one platform in a different platform. Also, as you read Couros‚Äô chapter, consider whether or not you have experienced a PLN either within your Learning Pod, or within the course. Have you been able to build trusting relationships within the class? Why or why not? Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read chapter 6, Developing Personal Learning Networks for Open and Social Learning (PDF download, sorry) in Emerging Technologies in Distance Education. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your seventh Wow and Wonder post and discuss your posts in your Learning Pods. ‚úîÔ∏è Follow several educators in your chosen social media platform (whatever that looks like in your platform). Then, to find more educators, see who they follow and follow them. Feel free to use your persona‚Äôs accounts as well as, or instead of, your own. ‚úîÔ∏è Begin drafting and composing your Celebration of Learning post so it isn‚Äôt a panic in the last week. ‚úîÔ∏è Continue Building your Major Project page. By the end of this week (Mar 13), you should have a substantial pull request to send your work from your Learning Pod‚Äôs repo to the main course repo. Please be in touch if you are confused about how to do this!! Do not wait! It is up to you to reach out for assistance. Week Ten (Mar 14-20) Quick shoutout to Learning Pod 4 who were the first to send a pull request with a bunch of content for their page! I left some comments in the commit, and they may be helpful to you as you format your own page, feel free to ask questions in the commit. In keeping with the ‚ÄòEnd of the Semester is Coming‚Äô vibe of the last week or so, I don‚Äôt have a lot of new content for you, although I would like to briefly revisit the topic that was scheduled for last week on the syllabus, which is to think about what it means to be a public individual on social media. I‚Äôd like you to read this article from the Globe and Mail about broadcaster Jody Vance and her experience as a high profile woman in BC and Canada who has a visible presence on Twitter. There are a few groups who have not been in contact with me recently and it would be very good to hear from you as the end of the semester is coming quickly and there is much work to do. If you go to the Network page, you can get a view of what activity has happened on the main repository and all the associated forks. ‚ú® ProTip I STRONGLY encourage you to have a look at the work that has been added to the course book so far! The whole point of the structure of this course is to give you visibility into what other groups and individuals are doing and to learn from and with each other. Work posted so far should be considered work-in-progress. ‚ú® ProTip You are also encouraged to create issues in the course repository if you have things to share with the class, need help, have questions, or maybe just want to compliment someone on their contribution. You can also interact directly with other groups by filtering the list of issues by label, then commenting on a particular group‚Äôs issue. Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Read the Globe and Mail article about Jody Vance. ‚úîÔ∏è Publish your Wow and wonder post for this week. No‚Ä¶let‚Äôs be done with those. Focus on your project and Celebration posts. ‚úîÔ∏è Continue working on your Major Project DUE MARCH 27 ‚úîÔ∏è Continue working on your Celebration of Learning post. Your Celebration post will likely end up being in the range of 1200-1500 words (150-200 words per course outcome). DUE APRIL 7 ‚úîÔ∏è One last thing‚Ä¶please add your name, linked to your blog to the index.Rmd file in your fork of the repository. You will see that Tessa‚Äôs name is already there and you should copy that syntax to ensure your link shows up properly. Then when you create a pull request I will add it to the main course site. Week Eleven (Mar 21-27) Getting right into it‚Ä¶there are two key due dates coming up. Sunday, March 27 Your Major Project is due. I‚Äôve added the last bit of what you need to do for that to the Major Project page. Please have a look there. ‚ú® ProTip Your Major Project is due on the 27th, but I will be scheduling assessment meetings to review your contributions between March 28th and April 2. You are welcome to submit updates between March 28 and our meeting. Thursday, April 7 Your Celebration of Learning post is due. Things To Do This Week ‚úîÔ∏è Complete your Major Project and create a pull request to send your work to the main repository. ‚úîÔ∏è Schedule a meeting between me and your Learning Pod to discuss your Major Project for sometime between March 28 and April 3. The link to book a meeting with me is in Brightspace. ‚úîÔ∏è Continue drafting your Celebration of Learning post, but focus on your Major Project if you need to budget your time. As always, feel free to book a meeting with me if you have questions!

Ultimately, you need to demonstrate to me that you have met the outcomes listed on the syllabus. In a course about social media and personal learning networks, that means you will have to demonstrate to me in your activities and in your reflections on those activities that you have, in one way or another, met the intended outcomes. Doing your work with that in mind will absolutely help you perform in the course. It also means that you will have to make your personal learning network interactions visible to me and to your fellow learners in the course. The way to do that is to tag your work in whatever platform you are interacting with edci338. The work you do will happen in two primary locations and some other secondary locations. Please see the Course Toolset for more details. The fundamental and core task in this course is for you to build and reflect on a Personal Learning Network (PLN) using modern networked tools. Your PLN will likely end up with two nodes by the time the course is complete. One node will be the network we build within this community of learners, while the other node (or maybe more) will be the professional connections you make outside the course. Hopefully, both nodes will persist beyond the end of the course, which is why it is critical that the work you do is NOT locked up in an institutional Learning Management System (LMS; Brightspace is the UVic LMS). Building Community Support This is an asynchronous online course, meaning that we don‚Äôt have any specific required meeting times. This can be a significant advantage for those who unable to meet at a particular time on in a particular place, but it can also contribute to challenges completing the coursework for those who prefer to work in more social contexts. We seek to strike a balance between learners working in isolation, and requiring on-campus meetings. To do this, there are three critical structures in the course: learning pods, weekly meetings, and assessment meetings with me. Learning Pods You will be provided a link to a password-protected page where you can sign up for a learning pod, which is a group of 3-4 learners who meet together regularly (ideally weekly) at a time that works for them. This time should be used to review the course materials and any questions that learners might have, and also to plan and organize work on the course assignments. Learning pods are intended to be your first line of support during the course. Weekly Meetings We will determine a time during the week that works for as many people as possible for a 1-hour meeting time with me. This meeting will not be required, but it is strongly recommended that you attend as many of these meetings as you are able. This will be a time to discuss the week‚Äôs readings, clarify questions about both the content and the logistics (what is due when and where) of the course. Assessment Meetings Each learning pod will be required to meet with me at least twice during the course. The first time will be within the first two weeks to ensure that you have been able to get set up with all the required tools and connected with a learning pod. The second required time will be prior to reading week to ensure that you are on track for the Major Project. Learning pods are also encouraged to book meeting times with me as needed. Community Contributions and Connections (30%) Throughout the course, you will be required to reflect on the work you are doing in relation to the topics of that particular week. This reflection will be in the form of blog posts on your own blog (either on opened.ca, or another blogging platform) and they will be due throughout the course. There are 8 prompts for you in the course and you will be required to respond to each of those. You will choose 2 to be assessed for grading as showcase posts (15% each for a total of 30%). Your 2 showcase posts will be polished for publication on your blog and should reflect a professional voice. Post Prompts (Reviewed in your Learning Pods) Your posts in response to each of the prompts will be in the form of one ‚ÄòWow‚Äô and one ‚ÄòWonder‚Äô. A Wow is anything from the week that caught your interest from the readings, videos, tasks, your PLN, or one of your fellow learners‚Äô posts. It should be something that you haven‚Äôt thought of before or maybe that you have changed your thinking about. A Wonder is something that you have a question about from the same sources. It might be something you thought wasn‚Äôt explained clearly, something that is counter-intuitive, doesn‚Äôt make sense, is muddy, or simply something you want to investigate further. Your Wow and Wonder posts can be brief (100-150 words) and in point form, but they must include a hyperlink to the artifact you are writing about and a brief reflection on why you chose that Wow or Wonder. Showcase Posts (2 @ 15% each) You will choose 2 of your Wow and Wonder posts and expand and polish them to be about 500 words. You should reference course artifacts and find resources not listed in the syllabus to inform and support your thinking about your Wows and Wonders. Set a goal for yourself of linking to at least 2 other learners in each showcase post. You are encouraged to diversify your interaction and reading of other learners in the community. You should find that these interactions lead to increased traffic on your own blog, which will provide opportunities to have your thinking supported, questions answered, and possibly new connections made. It is recommended that you comment on others‚Äô posts by including a link in your own post to the post you are commenting on. This will create a ‚Äòtrackback‚Äô on the original post, which is just like a comment. Make sure you check the comments on your own site because you will have to approve them before they are visible. You will see a notification in the side menu of WordPress when you have comments that need to be approved. Each Showcase post should: be about 500 words in length, include a featured image, include hyperlinks to relevant course materials and activities, include commentary on and hyperlinks to other EDCI338 learners‚Äô posts, a list of references including hyperlinks to cited work (use the style you are accustomed to) Suggested Prompts for Comments Please remember that these blogs are shared publicly, as are your comments. It is important to use your comments as a way to provide supportive, constructive feedback, to initiate a conversation, or to share connections. Keep your language positive, offer suggestions, and focus on the content of the blog post - discourse is encouraged. Examples of positive engagement include: My new thinking after reading your post is‚Ä¶ I agree with the idea of‚Ä¶ because‚Ä¶ I am wondering if you have read this article/website/book (share a resource link) I noticed that our thinking differs in this way‚Ä¶ A connection I made between your work and‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶ I really liked how you explained‚Ä¶and I am wondering if you can tell me more about‚Ä¶ Something I am wondering after reading your post is‚Ä¶ Major Project (40%) You will be working on the major project throughout the course and in collaboration with both a learning pod and also with the whole class. The end result of this work will be a polished e-book of resources for educators who want to learn about social media and building a PLN. For this project, you will be working in Learning Pods, a group of 3-4 learners working together to help each other succeed. Each Learning Pod will be responsible for researching and publishing resources about one social media tool that educators might use in their teaching. There is a preliminary list of tools on the toolset page. The platform we will use to create the resource will be GitHub, a tool specifically designed to enable remote teams to collaborate on complex projects. Git, the software that enables GitHub, was designed to aid the development of the Linux operating system. We will spend some time early in the course becoming familiar with GitHub and the terminology it uses. While this may sound intimidating, it is well within your capabilities to learn to use it. One thing you need to know about GitHub is that it makes everyone‚Äôs contributions visible to the whole community. We will all be working in the same space, and everyone in the class will be able to see what everyone else has contributed. Project Details You will work in your learning pods to complete the major project, which will be to create an online resource for educators wishing to learn about using social media tools to build a Personal Learning Network. Each Learning Pod will contribute an in-depth analysis of one networking tool that might be used in educational settings. The structure of each page in the resource will follow the topics and structure of the course, so you will be working on completing the major project as you progress through the course. Celebration of Learning (30%) Your final task in the course will be to tell me what you have learned. This will be one final post published on your blog in which you reflect on each of the course outcomes and how your work in the course contributed to meeting those outcomes. Your reflection must include references and hyperlinks to: - your own work in the course and an explanation of how your thinking was formed, - your colleagues‚Äô work in the course and an explanation of how their work informed your thinking, - course materials, including articles, videos, interviews, social media artifacts, etc. ‚ú® ProTip I STRONGLY recommend that you create this post as a draft at the beginning of the course and add to it throughout the course as we progress. It will be much more difficult to complete this post if you leave it until the end. An easy way to help yourself manage this is to create a set of outcome categories on your blog (outcome1, outcome2, etc) and apply those categories to the posts that meet those outcomes. Grading Standards Click here to read about the SOLO Taxonomy. "],["course-toolset.html", "Course Toolset Primary Tools Secondary Tools", " Course Toolset We will use a variety of tools in this course, as you might expect in a course about personal learning networks and using social media in education. One of the primary reasons for that is to allow opportunity for you to make your learning visible and to share it with the community, whatever that might look like for you. I recognize that you may be coming to this course for a variety of reasons, including as an elective for your Teacher Education program, but also as an elective in another program, for your own personal learning, or maybe because you heard about the series of courses that edtechuvic offers. Regardless of your reason for being here, you are welcome! It is important to note that we will be using multiple tools in this course, and I am aware that this can create challenges for people. While it is up to you to ensure that you have proper access to the information that you need, please ensure that you reach out to me if you have questions. These tools are central to the course content and it is literally my job to help you with this! Primary Tools These primary tools form the backbone of EDCI338 and are the core creation tools we will use. WordPress Instructions related to WordPress will appear inside blocks of this colour. WordPress will be our hub for EDCI338. The course hub is where I will post updates throughout the course and you are strongly encouraged to subscribe to receive notifications of updates using an email address that you often check. Additionally, you will sign up for and create your own WordPress site. It is on this site that you will publish your reflections on your work through the course. We have provided instructions for how to get set up on opened.ca. You may already have an ___.opened.ca website that you created for another EDCI course and you may use that one by simply adding an edci338 category to your posts. You may also use your own site through WordPress.com or another blogging tool, as long as the site publishes an RSS feed. The main caveat is that my ability to help troubleshoot your site may be more limited if you aren‚Äôt on opened.ca. GitHub A significant part of the work you will do for EDCI338 will be in the context of creating content using a collaborative tool. GitHub is a tool designed for the collaborative creation of software, but it can also be used for people looking to collaborate on text and multi-media documents. While GitHub may be unfamiliar to some of you, the workflow is not difficult to learn. - sign up with your uvic.ca email address to get a free upgrade. Secondary Tools The secondary tools are more topical in the course and will be the subjects of our explorations. Instructions related to secondary tools will appear inside blocks of this colour. An RSS Reader {-} There are numerous feed readers available on the web, but two that I recommend are Feedly and, my personal choice, Inoreader. Both offer free plans with ‚Äòpro‚Äô upgrades, but the free plans should be more than adequate for this course. Feed readers allow users to aggregate updates, or feeds, from various sources, such as blogs or news websites. Unfortunately, the free tier of most feed readers doesn‚Äôt include the ability to subscribe to social media feeds, such as Twitter or TikTok. A feed reader can help you stay in touch with others in this course as well as receive notifications on my updates.

"],["github-setup.html", "GitHub Setup Markdown Fork, Pull, Fetch Adding an Image", " GitHub Setup Github will be the main location of our collaborative work in EDCI338. While Github was created for teams to collaborate on coding projects, it can also be used for many other projects. Some of the language around interacting with Github might be new to you, but that is ok, it will seem foreign at first, but the whole point of you taking this course is to learn new skills, right?! I‚Äôm here to help. The first thing you might notice is that there are some weird punctuation marks in the raw text in Github. That is called Markdown, which is a way to tell web-browsers how to style text. The basics are super easy to learn, and they map pretty well to what you might do in a word processor. For example, in MS Word, if you want to indicate a heading, you put your cursor in the text, and choose the Heading 2 style. You can do the same thing in Markdown by simply adding two hashtags and a space before the text, like this‚Ä¶ ## Markdown Which shows up on the page like this‚Ä¶ Markdown Each heading level uses the corresponding number of hashtags. Heading levels # Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 #### Heading 4 ##### Heading 5 ###### Heading 6 Styling text You can also style text as italics *italics*, or bold **bold**, and you can also stack codes so bold italics ***bold italics***. Lists You can quickly and easily create an unordered list (bullets) with either a *, or a - followed by a space‚Ä¶ - berries - fruit - vegetables berries fruit vegetables You can create an ordered list by doing the same with a number and a .‚Ä¶ 1.

In this case, the image is in the assets/w1/ folder. Things To Do in GitHub ‚úîÔ∏è Register for an account. ‚úîÔ∏è Create a new repository called EDCI338 ‚úîÔ∏è choose ‚ÄòPrivate‚Äô in the visibility settings (step 4, above) ‚úîÔ∏è Go to the course repository ‚úîÔ∏è Click Issues, then New Issue, then Get Started to create a Learner Profile for yourself. ‚úîÔ∏è If you know who will be in your learning pod, please add the Label to your issue that corresponds with your Learning Pod, otherwise, you can just add a label that has fewer than 4 members already. Fork, Pull, Fetch Sometimes the lingo of Git and GitHub can be a bit confusing, and perhaps like there are too many steps to just save some work. Admittedly, the language does take some time to learn, but it is rather intuitive once it is explained. The way that we are using GitHub (editing content directly within the web interface) isn‚Äôt the typical workflow, but that is ok. You should think of the course repository, which I own, as the remote, meaning that it is the content stored on the web, not on your computer (which would be local). When you edit on GitHub, you have limited permission to make changes in that you can‚Äôt make changes directly to my repository, but rather, you need to propose changes, and ask me for permission to change the repository. You do this by creating a pull request, which is just you telling me that you have some proposed changes and asking me to pull them from your proposal into the repository. Creating a pull request like this is what allows us to collaborate on the repository without your changes overwriting the course materials. This creates a fair amount of friction in that you need to wait for me to approve your changes before you can proceed. There is a way around this though, and that is by creating a fork of the repository (several of you did this at the beginning of the course already). A fork is an exact copy of a repository at a particular point in time. So if you forked the course repo on January 14, you would have a copy of the course materials as they were on Jan 14, but there would be a notification that your copy is x number of commits behind the remote repo. If that is the case, you can catch up to the remote by clicking fetch upstream, then fetch and merge. Fetch and Merge in Github Once you have a fork of the repository, you can make all the changes you want to your copy of the repository, then, when you are ready, you can open a pull request to have your changes merged into the main repo. ‚ú® ProTip For EDCI338, you need to have ONE person from your learning pod with an up-to-date fork of the course repository, then the other people in the learning pod should fork that repository. for example, the main repo is at cmadland/edci-202201, and Chloe has a fork at chloelyh/edci338-202201, so each of Chloe‚Äôs learning pod members should fork chloelyh/edci338-202201. With this setup, each learning pod can be working on their own repo without any need for me to approve changes before they continue. then, when they are ready, each learning pod member opens a pull request with Chloe, who merges all the changes into her repo, then opens a pull request with my repo to merge all of those changes to the main. This way, each individual learning pod members‚Äô contributions are recorded along with the learning pod as a whole. Adding an Image Adding images requires a little bit of work, as it isn‚Äôt drag and drop like you might be used to in your word processor. That said, it‚Äôs relatively straightforward. Add a folder In your repository, click the assets folder, then click Add file, then Create new file. Add a new file in GitHub This step will only create a new folder for you; you won‚Äôt add the image yet. Enter the name of your social media platform and then type a / (this step is important!!) and then type a random word like sample or placeholder. Give the folder a title Give the file a name. Commit and push your changes. Since this is your own repo, you will be able to commit directly to the main branch of your repository. Commit your changes You will then have a folder with the title of your social media platform inside the assets folder. There will be one file inside your platform folder, but you can ignore or delete it. Prepare your image file. Your image should be relatively small (under 1MB), so if it is too large, you can compress it with tinypng.com. The filename should be as simple as possible; one word is ideal. Don‚Äôt use any capital letters, punctuation, spaces, or symbols other than - or _. Upload your image. Click into your new folder, and click Add file, then Upload files. You can either drag and drop your image, or navigate to the file on your computer. Commit your changes. Here is an instructional video highlighting this process See the instructions above for adding an image to a page. "],["tiktok.html", "Chapter 1 TikTok Persona Demographics Privacy and Surveillance Social Media and PLN in Education Balancing Your PLN and Public Discourse Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy", " Chapter 1 TikTok Persona Demographics Target Audience and Users TikTok is available in over 150 countries, storing the information of over 1 billion users. The widespread population of users has approximately 120 million users residing in the United States, 87 million from Indonesia and 72 million in Brazil. Surprisingly, Canada does not currently make the shortlist of countries (top 10), that hold the greatest number of users. Owed to the increase of technological advancement, it is evident why the main demographic of consumers is what is commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúGen Z‚Äù. A totalled 60% of users match Gen Z‚Äôs age group (individuals born between the years of 1997-2012) with a majority aged between 10-25 (Wallaroo, 2022.). With that being said, it should be noted that TikTok requires its users to meet the minimum age requirement of 13 years old. An older demographic of seniors can be seen on this app too, though they constitute an unusual subset. Similar success has been recorded of older generations, with great traction and activity on their platforms. To name a few, oldgays is a group of older men that share their thoughts and opinions on life, and cookingwithLynja shares insight on how to make yummy meals in a quick and easy fashion. In comparing the gender of TikTok‚Äôs users, there is an obvious breakdown of genders and their active use on the app. To date, identified females make up the majority of users with a remainder of male users (39%) and others (2%) constituting the rest. TikTok targets individuals with interests and hobbies of all sorts. Promising a guarantee for users to be matched with creators that align with their hobbies and interests, running from fashion to baking, dance and/ or travel. Tiktok has enabled users to create business accounts to allow for easy, accessible and reviewal of the accounts analytics. Businesses in particular have greatly utilized the analytics page to pinpoint the age, gender, and likes of their active users. The information received from the analytics, successfully supplies and equips companies with the proper tools to adapt and progress. 1 Non-users TikTok does not require users to create an account to browse the platform. There are a variety of methods that allow non-users to navigte the platform. With a few simple steps, users that do not wish make an account are able to view the content. The first option consists of following three simple steps: 1. Go to TikTok.com 2. Select ‚ÄúFor you‚Äù on the left sidebar 3. Begin watching videos without logging into an account Videos made and created on TikTok‚Äôs platform can also be viewed on other neighbouring media platforms. Multiple channels on youtube have dedicated their content to uploading what is currently trending on TikTok. Content creators of youtube make it possible for users without an account to gain quick and easy access to like and comment on the video on youtube. TikTok videos may also be viewed without an account if they‚Äôre sent by message, Snapchat, email, Facebook etc. With that being said, there are a variety of features that can not be accessed by users without an account. Guest users features are restricted and they are unable to follow creators, like videos, see or write comments on the videos, upload or share content or join creators ‚Äòlives‚Äô. How Users are Connected TikTok features allow users to generate communities online. Users can stay connected through the act of sharing, following, commenting or liking other creators‚Äô posts. Simply by locating and following a creator‚Äôs account, their videos will be readily available for viewing in the ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù section of TikTok. Unless the creator‚Äôs content is made private, a user does not need to wait for access to be granted, in order to proceed in viewing the video of the account. Furthermore, there are no obligations for users to follow one another back, however, access to the creator‚Äôs videos is still made available regardless of mutual following. There exists two types of pages to view content. The ‚Äòfor you page‚Äô showcases viral TikToks and creators of all sorts. This side of TikTok may allow users to discover new creators they wish to connect with or follow. After the user has followed the creator, their content may now exist on the other side of TikTok. Separated into two sections, the videos published by the users following will appear on the ‚Äòfollowing‚Äô page, while other creators will appear on the ‚Äúfor you page‚Äù. The users following page exists to serve individuals with accessible access to their favourite content creators and avoid missing out on their friend‚Äôs and families‚Äô posts. Another way to interact on TikTok is to engage in creators‚Äô ‚Äúlives‚Äù. Users may choose to go live to interact with their followers in real-time. By sharing insight into their daily living, creators have found great success expanding their followers and creating user engagement. Another unique feature allows for creators to go live with other fellow creators on the app. TikTok lives provide users with access to comment, ask questions and send or receive gifts. Although, TikTok requires users to meet a following of 1,000 and be 16 years of age in order to host a live. Content Content Sharing On TikTok, users have the ability to share any post they see on their feed. In order to share a video, users must tap the arrow located in the bottom right hand corner. Once the user has clicked the share arrow, a variety of methods to share are displayed. These options include the ability to share the video through copying the link or sharing it on another social media platform such as Snapchat, Messages, Facebook messenger or Instagram. share Privately Sharing Content When a user initially creates a TikTok account, the videos and comments are set to be public. This means any TikTok user can access the content and follow the account. However, TikTok does have Privacy settings that allow the account to be changed to private. When the account is set to private, the account holder can approve or deny follow requests and only their approved followers can view the content. Even if the account is set to public, the account holder has access to edit the privacy settings on individual videos. These privacy settings allow users to allow everyone access, only the followers that users follow back, or only the account holder to view the video. content Viral Content Content published on TikTok has the ability to go viral any time a user creates and uploads a public video onto their account. If the content a user creates gets picked up by the TikTok algorithm, it will be shared to other users via the ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù page. Based on the user‚Äôs interests and past interactions with TikTok videos, the platforms analytics curates a ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù page of video content from creators the user may not follow. The algorithm utilizes users‚Äô data on interactions with videos such as the screen time of watching a video, liking the video, and/or sharing it. foryou Once the video makes it to the ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù page, it has the opportunity to go viral. As a video receives more comments, likes, shares, and duets, the greater its chances are of being picked up by the algorithm. The completion rate of a users‚Äô videos is an additional factor that influences ranking. In short, the more a video is liked and fully watched, the greater it‚Äôs chances are of going viral. 2 Business Details Private Parent Company The founder, Chairman and former CEO Zhang Yiming created ByteDance in 2012 and developed the video sharing app TikTok aswell. ByteDance, Tiktok‚Äôs parent company, is based in Beijing, storing the information of over a billion users worldwide. As the name implies a parent company serves to control the interests of another company. The parent company is privately owned by a Chinese tech company, with no opportunities for other interested parties to buy in. Major Investors Despite the main ownership of TikTok being owned by the Beijing-based tech company commonly referred to as ‚ÄúByteDance‚Äù, in recent years pressure by the Trump Administration forced Bytedance to expand and create a new company referred to as TikTok Global. These steps allowed Americans to feel safe about the storing and gathering of their citizen‚Äôs information, as opposed to China potentially using it to gain insight and track Americans. To date, the current minority owners are Oracle and Walmart. Oracle holds a 12.5% stake in the company, with Walmart at 7.5%. Revenue Generated The business model of leading social media apps are quite similar to one another and lead to the generation of profits. While TikTok is free to download, the network does exceptionally well from paid advertisements and in-app-purchases. Scrolling through the ‚Äúfor-you‚Äù page, embedded in-feed ads will begin on auto-play. Tiktok will direct ads based on the user‚Äôs interactiveness with certain content. This is very helpful for businesses to grow, network and generate profits, however, the current cost of in-feed ads start at a minimum of $10 per Cost Per thousand/ mile views (CPM). Furthermore, there also exists brand-takeover ads, which begin to play an ad from the moment the app is launched. Businesses may prefer to buy into these ads, to grab the attention of their target audience while they are most attentive. To view ads, a more prestigious form of advertising consists of longer adds up to 60 seconds that pop up during the duration of a user‚Äôs activity on the app. Branded hashtag challenges also exist to create brand awareness. The hashtag appears on the discovery page as a fun way to boost user engagement and get messages across. Lastly, branded effects offered by TikTok allow businesses to purchase custom stickers or filters that can be used by users on TikTok for a period of 10 days. As for in-app purchases, TikTok has utilized virtual coins to be purchased and shared among its users. Ranging from 100 to 10,000 virtual coins, the price can vary between 99 cents- $99.99. The in-app currency allows users to show appreciation for the content they engage in and enjoy! 3 Privacy and Surveillance TikToks ToS and Privacy Policy Terms of Service Privacy Policy Privacy Policy for Younger Users Key Takeaway‚Äôs from TikToks Privacy Policy The Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy (PP) serve as a legally binding contract between TikTok and its users. Confined within this document is advanced terminology that the average person would find difficult to comprehend. A crucial point stated in the document notes that Tiktok is not held accountable for the privacy policy of third-party partnerships and advertisements that are provided in the app via Cookies (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 20). Following that, Tiktok is also not liable if the user is to click a link outside or from a Third-party source (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 37). Under the section ‚ÄòUser Content and Behavioural Information‚Äô TikTok explains that by giving informed consent, the app may collect users‚Äô information present in their content including their background, face, location and bodily attributes. They also disclose information that may be obtained regarding your interests, gender, and age as means to ‚Äúpersonalize‚Äù content and ‚Äú[promote] your content to other users and explore whether your profile presents further opportunities for collaboration‚Äù (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 10). With reference to the Privacy Policy for Younger Users (YUPP), the document was substantially shorter than that of the General Privacy Policy (GPP). The Policy states that limited information is obtained from youth under the age of 13 residing in the United States (US). This includes the username, password, date of birth, device ID, IP address, web browser type and some app activity (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 1-2 ). This information is only acquired for troubleshooting and other analytical services. In addition, this is also collected for legal and governmental reasons which not only is rare but is reasonable as it is law enforcement. (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 4 &amp; 6). An apparent difference found between the YUPP and GPP resides in the difference of protection between users. Those who are 13 and under are subject to much less severe policies and are inclined to more privacy. In contrast, those who are over the age of 14 are forced to forgo their privacy and grant TikTok access to a great deal of their personal information. Users should be encouraged to review the Policy Acts laid out by TikTok, in order to be fully made aware of and comfortable with their decision to sacrifice their privacy rights. TikTok recommends that any questions or concerns with respect to the ToS or PP be directly addressed to them via email (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 34). 4 5 6 Social Media and PLN in Education Interactions on TikTok Tiktok serves as a great resource for individuals to interact with other content creators, comedians or those in the arts community. The platform includes a plethora of features that allow its users to comment, like, share and send gifts to their favourite content creators. Leaving Comments A comment can easily be made on TikTok with a few simple steps! 1. Select the video you plan to interact with. 2. From here, you must tap the comment icon located on the right. 3. Tap the ‚Äúadd comment‚Äù box and write a message. 4. Lastly, press send when you‚Äôre ready! 7 Liking Liking a video has never been easier for TikTok users. In order to like a video, one can simply tap the heart shaped icon located in the middle right side of the page. How to Like When a user likes the content produced by a content creator, the like is viewed by the person who made the video. However, it should be noted that unless settings are switched to be private, the video can be viewed by all. Attached below are numerical steps to be followed if one wishes to switch their ‚Äúlike history‚Äù to not be viewed by others. Creators Educators on TikTok Educators use TikTok as a platform to reach audience members from all over the world. TikTok provides a platform for creators to share their voices and knowledge. Videos are created with the intent to educate viewers, answer questions and promote learning. All types of content are currently being taught on TikTok. Educators such as Dad, how do I? provides valuable life lessons and educates viewers on how to fix things. Users can also access Janelle Rohner‚Äôs content which educates viewers on Keto lifestyles and provides weight loss tips. Depending on the type of content the creators produce, this determines the type of audience members. For instance, Dad, how do I? has an audience of mostly young people while Janelle Rohner‚Äôs audience is an older audience as some of the content she shares is keto drinks for those 19+. No matter the topic of interest, there is sure to be a content creator producing educational content on that particular topic. Educators Response to Comments and Questions A majority of creators prioritize replying and addressing questions made by their audience to create engagement and provide continstency. Comments can directly be responded to in a video, and is often done so by creators. When a question has been asked, educators may produce a video that shows the question being asked and them addressing it. This way, they can directly address the comments and/or questions of their viewers. An example of this is shown below. TikTok as a PLN Educators on TikTok are able to use the platform as a Personal Learning Network (PLN). For instance, TikTok provides educators with a space to share and utilize worksheets, assignments and activities that fellow teachers have created. The growth of TikTok has allowed it to beome a virtual team to distribute and swap ideas. The app can be a great tool for teacher to expand their personal learning networks and gain insight on useful methods employed by teacher alike. Educational Post on TikTok Experience An educational video that instructs users with numerical steps to create ‚Äúvegan ceviche‚Äù was created and posted by all group members. Provided is a link, published by one of the 3 persona accounts on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiagreen111/video/7077332572879015173?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1 Tiktoks platform allows for users to create, distribute and share educational videos, 15-60 seconds in length. Added features such as voice overs, make it easier for users to record first, and explain after. In addition, education is not only limited to users viewing the videos content, but rather it continues when users engage in the comment section. This gives the creator the opportunity to respond and interact with their audience, and demonstrate consistency. In reviewing the responses to the TikTok published on all three persona accounts, there were no significant differences. The amount of views received fluctuated between all 3 personas ranged from 76 to 805 views. Despite the seemingly high number of viewers, all 3 accounts fell between 3-7 likes. Sophia Green, persona created to reflect a social justice seeker, received the most views and likes on her platform. By incorporating popular hashtags in the caption section, she was able to generate a bigger audience. By using hashtags such as vegan or sustainable, it has the potential to be seen by over 19.3 billion users that have already keyed that search. The imlemtation of hashtags is not a new concept, but rather it is used as an extremely effective approach by influencers, artists and creators alike to generate a bigger followings. In the same manner, Lindsay Adams took advantage of hashtags by adding ones such as #healthy living, #yogasnacks, #vegan and #fuelyourbody. The use of these popular hashtags most likely played a contributing role to help TikTok place this video onto the ‚Äòfor you pages‚Äô of individuals whose interest and previously liked videos were in line with the hashtags used. With all this being said, it is clear by TikTok‚Äôs analytics, that each account must employ tips and tricks made by fellow creators to grow in likes, comments and follows within their platform. For future educational posts, success may be found in making use of more popular hashtags and trending hashtags. In addition, staying up to date with trending sounds and dances is an important and useful way to keep users engaged. Concerns with TikTok As with any social media platform, educators should be aware of the inappropriate content that can be accessed on the app. The most obvious sources of adult content on TikTok are profanity and suggestive clothing. Although the minimum age for a TikTok user is 13 years old, the app does not use any age verification tools when users are creating an account. With the ability to search any hashtag or keywords in the app, users can access any content created by another user. Although TikTok has strict guidelines on nudity and graphic content, since any user can upload their opinions on any topic, offensive content may be shared on the app. Due to the nature of the social media app, when a video becomes viral millions of people can be impacted by ampliganda. According to DiRestas, ampliganda is the new word for misinformation in the digital age. On TikTok, any user can now shape perceptions and realities by having their ideology amplified through shares, likes, and comments of a mass audience. 8 ^ [DiResta, R. (2021, October 5). It‚Äôs Not Misinformation. It‚Äôs Amplified Propaganda. The Atlantic.(https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/disinformation-propaganda-amplification-ampliganda/620334/)] Other Things a Curious Educator May Want to Know A curious educator should know that TikTok is meant to help empower them. When an educator joins TikTok they are given a platform separate from their institution which often limits and controls what they are able to do and say. TikTok is created to help anyone share their voice and find an audience to share it with. There are so many educators who join TikTok and use it as an extenion of their classroom. However, unlike in a classroom, on TikTok there is not a limited number of seats to teach. Instead, there is an entire world of individuals you have the ability to educate and impact. Pre pandemic, educators perhaps would have viewed social media apps as a distraction to their students. Nevertheless, amidst the global pandemic where times have never been more uncertain, TikTok offers educators a platform to post educational videos which may help students learn online. Educators have the opportunity to utilize TikTok as a mini classroom in which they can post shortened condensed video lessons for students who may have missed a class or for students who may benefit from a refresher on the class. Social media apps have gained such popularity and rather than punishing students for using them, educators should hop on the trend and use them to their benefit to appeal to their students. Balancing Your PLN and Public Discourse High Profile Individuals Social media has provided an outlet for celebrities and high-profile individuals the opportunity to provide direct insight into their daily lives. It serves as a safer means for celebrities to interact with their following and allows for immediate answers to trending news. Tiktok is an excellent example, of a social media platform that allows for easy, direct communication between a celebrity and their following. Celebrities employ the features on the app to generate loyalty with their fans and boost follower engagment. Their humanistic traits allow celebrities to be just as susceptible to making mistakes. Social media allows high-profile individuals the ability to share their stances on political or personal matters, and apologize for their shortcomings. Their personal platform allows for fans alike to comment, like and show support. In order to stay in the public eye, it is crucial that high-profile individuals are consistent and make time for posting, going live, or even replying to comments. The current apps that surface to date allow for friends and families to stay connected, despite geographical separation. Celebrities share similarily to the general population, with the desire to connect in the same fashion. Brand, movie or music deals, often require high-profile individuals to create awareness and promote the upcoming release dates of finished products. It is evident that social media provides high-profile individuals accessible tools to promote growth, interaction and connection with targetted audiences. Benefits of Being in the Public Eye on TikTok &amp; Having a PLN Personal learning networks provide a welcoming space for the formation of global communities. Worldwide users are able to tap into the broad wealth of knowledge while taking a special interest in their personal area of focus. In recent years, personal learning networks have closed the gap of keeping users up to date with global news, updated ideas and trends. Without a presence in the public eye, one may not be equipped with the everchanging realm of education that exists in today‚Äôs societal context. Becoming a user on the social network gives direct and accessible access to the building of relationships, sharing of expertise, staying educated and staying in contact with friends and family. Visibility also remains a primary benefit to the continued engagement in social media. Users that take pride in their presence on social media through pushing and engagement in content will reak the benefits, and may become a name that others rely on for information. For example, NDP leader [Jagmeet Singh] (https://www.tiktok.com/@thejagmeetsingh?lang=en) has benefited tremendously from being on TikTok. He is in the public eye constantly on the news, however, he has been able to be in the eye of a younger audience through his presence on TikTok. Being that the younger generations have the lowest voting count in history, his TikToks have been able to encourage higher voter turnout. His Personal learning networks are notoriously known for their value in providing a third-person perspective on ones practice(s). Furthermore, they serve to build an open community of learners, that engage by choice and are free from limitations. Employers Limiting Factors, Restrictions and Benefits The review of users who have high profiles outside of the TikTok Platform resulted in the location of Doritos‚Äô TikTok page. Considering Doritos is a popular brand and has a high following on TikTok, they‚Äôre a perfect example of a user on the platform who is not only TikTok famous. The person who creates videos for Doritos‚Äô TikTok page is restricted in the kind of content they can publish, as it must be ‚Äúbrand-friendly‚Äù. Due to the apps ability to share and gain opinions and stories, as well as the ability to see the behind-the-scenes of strangers‚Äô lives, TikTok has gained a lot of traction over the last few years. However, in creating content for a popular brand like Doritos, there are limitations in sharing controversial opinions as the brand does not want the public to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù them. Although users‚Äô who share relatable content on Tiktok can become famous, that fame can easily be taken away if the public deemed their content offensive. Nevertheless, if the videos Doritos posts on TikTok gains a lot of views, it is great advertising for the company and can potentially gain new buyers. Reliability Personal learning networks allow for individuals to interact and create online learning communities, despite geographical differences. For this reason, it becomes of paramount importance that users pinpoint their education needs, in order to locate a suitable audience and collaborators that suffice desirable learning outcomes. An area of difficulty that remains, is the possibility of falsified information. To ensure a reliable PLN is created one must be considerate of the information they‚Äôre reviewing. When reading an article it is essential to be skeptical of the information, even if something is presented as a fact this does not instantly certify that it is. Education that provides users with tools to determine validity, serves as a great educational tool that can be used to investigate information being displayed. The purpose of online learning networks is to challenge different points of view by utilizing a platform to interact with fellow users. To only engage with posts that align with personal beliefs or ideas, defeats the purpose of continued growth and understanding. Leading by demonstration is a commonly referred to saying, for it serves great success in creating an unspoken standard that exists in all areas of focus. By becoming a leading example, users will likely follow suit and partake in regular online activity, the sharing of viable resources and give consistent effort. Minimizing Misinformation There are a variety of reasons for which misinformation is shared. People may share it because they believe it to be true or, they may be sharing the misinformation for entertainment or sarcastic purposes. Veteran storytellers are able to minimize the risk of sharing misinformation by holding themselves accountable and adhering to TikToks community guidelines. The policies outlined work to prevent misleading, harmful and or deceptive accounts off of TikTok and eliminate the spread of misinformation (Pappas, 2020). Within the guidelines, it states that all information with the potential to cause harm to a community or larger population is prohibited. As a means to help dilute the amount of misinformation being spread, TikTok has entered into an agreement with third-party apps to provide ‚Äúfact checks‚Äù of the content that has been created on their platform (Pasquetto et al., 2020). Although fact-checking is not able to eliminate misinformation entirely, it provides an excellent way to diminish misinformation. Alongside fact-checking, there also is a subset of users who have taken it upon themselves to help stop the spread of misinformation. The video enlisted below received significant praise and remains a highly recommended resource to all users that utilize platforms as a means to share and accumulate knowledge. https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/how-tiktok-creators-are-tackling-misinformation-111242821989 In this video, a creator on TikTok delves into her experience counteracting the prevalence of misinformation and racism on another user‚Äôs platform. Critical solutions are in high demand, pushing for the help of governments, special interest groups and platform creators. Despite the current use of fact-checking, community guidelines and user accountability, there is yet to be a viable solution to completely eradicate misinformation altogether. 9 10 Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy Digital Identity In recent decades, generations have become more technologically adept, increasing the number of hours spent sharing, liking and posting on social media. The social network holds over 4.62 million users, with 424 million new users joining in the last 12 months. The growing numbers are proof that users consistenly utilize the features offered on the plethora of social media platforms avaliabe. Further analysis of users profiles that compare the apparent difference between personal and professional identities allow for users to recognize personal traces left behind on social media sites. The visitor and resident map was a valuable tool to map out our groups presence on social media and learn from it. Learners can make use of V&amp;R mapping to assist in the visualization of trends on the internet by the user (White &amp; Cornu, 2011) . As a guide, the horizontal axis shows where social media activity can be placed in relation to the resident side (left) or the visitor side (right). By following the vertical axis, social media activity can be placed near the personal side (top) or institutional side (bottom). Creating a collective group map encompassing each members social media use facilitated intellectual discussion as we compared our personal, institutional, visitor and residence placements to one anothers. Collectively agreeing that we used TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and VSCO on a day-to-day basis. This activity allowed us to become well aware of the trace we leave on social media platforms. Our placement of different web tools in the quadrants led us to notice that our twitter and personal email (residential use) began as personal but gradually became more institutional as the semester progressed. We were able to identify UVIC‚Äôs email platform to strictly be used for professional purposes only. With no communication between friends and family, it remains a hub that is only visited. The placement of TikTok caused great grief amongst our group. Accordingly, we deciced to create two separate categories that would include our school persona (Ariel Fipke, Lindsay Adams, Sophia Green) and our individual personal accounts. With countless hours spent on TikTok, it was fitting that it was placed in the middle right quadrant, to showcase the personal use spent on the apps platform. Continued time spent liking, commenting, and sharing of videos, allows for TikTok to monitor and collect personal content preferences in accordance with its users. In contrast, the persona accounts created in this course were placed in the bottom right hand quadrant. Despite, our daily login use on our personal persona accounts, it was used to satisfy school (institutional) requirements, rather than personal. 11 V&amp;R Media Literacy, Trust and Disinformation TikTok has many moderation policies in effect which are constantly evolving and changing to suit the needs of their growing platform. There are community guidelines set in place to establish set norms and a code of conduct to which all users must adhere to. Any content which violates the community guidelines is removed by TikTok. Additionally, accounts or users who engage in severe or repetitive violations of the platform are temporarily banned or removed altogether. Within the community guidelines, there are rules in effect to protect minor safety and action is taken against any behaviour which constitutes sexual exploitation of minors, grooming behaviours, nudity and sexual activity of minors, harmful activities of minors, crimes against minors etc. The moderation policies also exclude any behaviour which promotes, normalizes or glorifies dangerous acts and challenges including suicide, self-harm and disordered eating. TikTok does not condone, bullying or harassment, adult nudity and sexual activities, violent extremism, hateful behaviour, impersonation or misinformation of any sort. (Tiktok. February, 2022.) When a user creates an account on TikTok they sign an agreement to follow these community guidelines. However, if they are not followed further actions are taken. TikTok will either themselves remove the content, or other TikTok users may report any content they believe does not fit within community guidelines. 12 In addition to the removal of TikTok videos that share in the spread of misinformation, fact-checkers also serve to combat the prevalence and spread of misinformation on the app. Fact-checkers aren‚Äôt able to verify the entirety of the information present in the video published. For this reason, it becomes of great importance that Tiktok has now decided to flag all videos that the fact-checkers were inconclusive on. Each video that has been flagged will appear as follows (Perez, 2021.): Flagged Video If the user decides to still share the video despite being given a pre-warning about the potential misinformation they are sharing, TikTok may intervene and the video will become ineligible for promotion on the ‚ÄúFor You Page.‚Äù TikTok also works to provide trusted links to the TikTok community. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an in-app notice was introduced so when hashtags related to the pandemic were searched by users, links to World Healths Organizations‚Äô websites were provided so that users could see trusted information. They also expanded on this by creating an information hub in-app as means to continue to provide the TikTok community with an abundance of resources related to accurate and trusted resources (Tiktok, 2022.). Despite the many efforts TikTok has put fourth in attempt to combat misinformation, fact checkers effectiveness remain a point of concern with it‚Äôs funding directly stemming from the app itself. In Jim Lukes blog post ‚Äúthat‚Äôs no plagiarism detector‚Äù 13it discusses the true intentions behind the online plagiarism detector, formily known as Turnitin. This article, with reason, prompts others to reevaluate TikTok‚Äôs fact checkers validity and be questioned in the same way. Turnitin, a company which was meant to eliminate plagiarism in the school system also served the purpose of helping institutions save money by robotically grading student papers, reducing the amount of required faculty members. As stated in Miah Armitage‚Äôs Wow and Wonder Week 8 Post14, she was ‚Äúutterly shocked to learn the intentions behind Turnitin.‚Äù Being that a plagiarism checker is being payed to do much more than simply detect plagiarism, it causes a question to circulate around the authenticity of fact checkers and whether they are doing more than they claim. It can also be hard to believe that TikTok fact checkers have pure intentions strictly meant to eliminate misinformation when there are many testimonials from TikTok creators who have been banned or shadow banned on the platform when they have not violated the guidelines in any way. 15 16 Misinformation and disinformation will never entirely go away. Social media platforms have taken steps to curb the prevalence, though further assistance is required of its users to evaluate information before sharing. Education serves an important role in building familiarity with misinformation techniques, to allow users to recognize misinformation posts and avoid engaging in or sharing. Another important step is to become aware of personal biases, as research has shown vulnerability directly related to the confirmation of one‚Äôs own pre-existing bias. TikTok recognizes that despite the multitude of benefits its platform offers, it can also be used as an easy outlet for both misinformation and disinformation to spread. The app has promised to combat the appearance of these untrustworthy sources by introducing a new feature that would highlight the unreliability of unverified content, thereby slowing its spread throughout the app (Stokel-Walker, 2021). In the case that a video is published without the chance for a TikTok moderator to review and fact check the video, a message will appear. This banner will cross the screen stating that the video may contain unconfirmed content (Stokel-Walker, 2021). In addition, if the user attempted to share the video, another message would appear to remind the user of the unverified content in the video and ask to confirm their willingness to proceed and share it. This additional feature has shown great success with a 24% decrease in users sharing unverified content, after being reminded of its questionable validity (Stokel-Walker, 2021). Wallaroo (Ed.).

We will add to the project week-by-week and will act as each others‚Äô peer reviewers as we go so that the final result after the next 6 weeks is a user-friendly resource for others seeking information on particular social media platforms. Sign up for a Social Media Platform The first thing we need to do is to have each Learning Pod ‚Äòsign up‚Äô to a particular social media platform. This will be the platform that you use as the basis for your Final Project. The structure of the project is such that we can only have one group working on a particular social media platform, so it will be first-come-first-served for the sign up. GitHub will track the specific time that issues are added and will display the issues in reverse chronological order on the issues page. ‚ú® Follow These Steps‚Ä¶ ‚úîÔ∏è Create an new issue in the Course Repository (not a learner profile, you‚Äôll have to click the ‚ÄòOpen a blank issue‚Äô link) and add: ‚úîÔ∏è each of your Learning Pod members as assignees ‚úîÔ∏è me as an assignee ‚úîÔ∏è your Learning Pod label ‚úîÔ∏è a new label identifying the social media platform you are signing up for (make sure it isn‚Äôt already taken). ‚úîÔ∏è the ‚ÄòEDCI338 Major Project‚Äô project. Looks like I will have to do that bit. There are obviously many social network platforms to choose from, some of which are more popular than others. If another pod claims a platform that your pod was hoping to claim, in addition to adding a new label for your second-choice platform, add a comment in your issue and a link to the issue that has already claimed your first-choice platform. We might be able to differentiate your projects enough to allow two groups to explore a single platform. No promises. Create Personas Now that you have chosen a social media platform, it‚Äôs time to get organized. The issue that you created in step 1 will become the main home for conversations about your project. Please edit your issue and add the following checklist to the ‚ÄòDescription‚Äô section‚Ä¶ - [ ] Personas - [ ] Demographic Information - [ ] Digital Identity - [ ] Privacy and Surveillance - [ ] Access and Inclusion - [ ] Trust and Misinformation - [ ] Public Discourse - [ ] Education - [ ] Media Literacy - [ ] Reflections You first task is to create as many Personas as there are members in your Learning Pod. The reason for this is to allow everyone the opportunity to create accounts on your platform of choice from behind the curtain of an imagined persona. There are some people who cannot and should not be public on the web, and this is a way to provide some anonymity. You need not engage in research of a typical user on your chosen platform, but simply imagine the characteristics of someone who might want to engage on the platform. I encourage you to imagine a diversity of personas with various characteristics and backgrounds. You can certainly draw from your own experiences as inspiration for your personas, but you are not required to do so. You are welcome to use xtensio.com to create your personas, but other tools like Canva.com may be useful as well. You can use an image from generated.photos/, which generates face images through AI, meaning you don‚Äôt have to worry about having to ask someone for permission to use their photo. ‚úîÔ∏è Upload your personas as images to a folder with the name of your social media platform inside the ‚Äòassets‚Äô folder in the course book. ‚úîÔ∏è Embed your persona images on your platform page in the course book. Demographics At this point, you should have ONE person in your learning pod who has forked the course repository and the other members of your learning pod who have been added as collaborators to that fork. GitHub Fork Set-up for each Learning Pod Each Learning Pod will first contribute to their fork of the course repository owned by one of the pod members. Once you have enough content drafted and you‚Äôd like to share with the rest of the class, you can open a ‚ÄòPull Request‚Äô in GitHub to send your contributions over to the main course repo. I will be automatically notified and will need to approve these pull requests, so maybe aim for 1 pull request per learning pod per week (we can see how this goes and adjust if necessary)? Make sure you only edit on your own .Rmd page to avoid conflicts in the GitHub content. Your content will show in the course book after it has been merged and I build the book again. Add the following information to your page in the course book. Describe your chosen platform in significant detail, including, as available (Wikipedia may be a good source for some of this info): ‚úîÔ∏è target audience (age, demographics, political leaning, interests, hobbies, etc) ‚úîÔ∏è can non-users browse or search content? ‚úîÔ∏è how are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating) ‚úîÔ∏è can content be shared privately? ‚úîÔ∏è how is content shared? ‚úîÔ∏è how does content go viral? ‚úîÔ∏è is the parent company public or private? ‚úîÔ∏è who are the major investors? ‚úîÔ∏è how does the company generate revenue? ‚úîÔ∏è any other pertinent information‚Ä¶ Privacy and Surveillance Download a copy of the platform‚Äôs Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy and, as a learning pod, see what you can find out about how the platform uses your data and/or tracks your movements. This will not be the most fun you‚Äôve had. Here are some resources to help you comb through the documents: ‚úîÔ∏è I read the Terms of Service, so that you don‚Äôt have to ‚úîÔ∏è Terms of Service; Didn‚Äôt Read Add the following to your platform‚Äôs page in the course book: ‚úîÔ∏è a link to your platform‚Äôs ToS and Privacy Policy ‚úîÔ∏è your key takeaways from your examination of your platform‚Äôs ToS and Privacy Policy Social Media and your PLN in Education In Week Nine, you were instructed to follow some educational accounts in your chosen social media platform. You are encouraged to find a mix of more formal accounts of teachers and administrators in K-12 and faculty and instructors in higher ed (you might also find many accounts of instructional designers and people who work in faculty development), and less formal accounts of people who are sharing their knowledge on the platform outside of formal accredited educational systems. You are also encouraged to set up accounts using the characteristics of the personas that you created a few weeks ago (if you are allowed to create such accounts), and to set up your own accounts to see how different personas ‚Äòexperience‚Äô social media differently. Feel free to interact with the educators you follow, either directly or indirectly (each platform will look different). Add the following to your platform‚Äôs page in your Learning Pod‚Äôs repo: ‚úîÔ∏è Describe how people are able to interact in your platform. Can people leave comments on content? Is there a quick and easy way to ‚ÄòLike‚Äô or ‚Äòfavourite‚Äô something? Who sees that ‚Äòlike‚Äô? Do creators generally respond to comments on their content? ‚úîÔ∏è How do educators use the platform? What kinds of content are they teaching? Who is their audience? Do they respond to comments or questions? Are they using the platform as a PLN, or are they only creating content? ‚úîÔ∏è In your Learning Pod, plan and publish more than one *SHORT educational ‚Äòpost‚Äô (whatever that looks like on your platform). Don‚Äôt put huge amounts of effort into your post. A simple ‚ÄòProTip‚Äô or ‚ÄòLifeHack‚Äô type of post, or a ‚ÄòDid you know‚Ä¶[something you know about‚Ä¶]‚Äô. Publish your posts on a few of your Learning Pod‚Äôs accounts. How do people respond to your post? Do they respond to the same post differently depending on the persona of the account? ‚úîÔ∏è Are there any concerns that educators should be aware of regarding your platform (privacy, age-inappropriate content, disinformation, misinformation, offensive or illegal content)? ‚úîÔ∏è Make note of other things you notice that a curious educator might want to know about your platform. ‚úîÔ∏è By the end of the week, you should have enough content to create a pull request to send your work over to the main course blog, where I will set up some peer reviews (not for grades). Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse In Week Ten you read about Jody Vance and her experience as a high profile woman on social media. Based on her account of her experiences on Twitter, explore your platform for individuals who have high profiles outside your platform. For example, this means Learning Pod 1 should find a few high profile people on TikTok who aren‚Äôt just ‚ÄòTikTok famous‚Äô, but who have a high profile elsewhere. An example might be a musical artist who happens to be on TikTok, or a politician, etc. Here are some questions to guide your reflections to be added to your Major Project page (you don‚Äôt necessarily need to address all of these questions): Add the following to your platform‚Äôs page in your Learning Pod‚Äôs repo: ‚úîÔ∏è How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media? ‚úîÔ∏è What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN? ‚úîÔ∏è Building community with online tools provided by an employer can be limiting, what are some possible restrictions and benefits? ‚úîÔ∏è Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on? ‚úîÔ∏è How do those who are veteran story tellers minimize the risk of sharing misinformation? GitHub ProTip It is easy in GitHub to include footnotes in your work to cite sources. Please follow the instructions below to create footnotes. ‚úîÔ∏è If you are creating a footnote to reference google, it would be ^[[Google.com](https://google.com)]. ‚úîÔ∏è If you are citing an article, it would be ^[Hirst, M.

Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy (including Trust and Disinformation) This is the last section for your Major Project and you can determine within your group how to divide the work. Please add a reflection for each of the remaining topics in the checklist: ‚úîÔ∏è Digital Identity How do you present yourself in social media? Do you have separate identities for personal and work or school use? Do you integrate your personal and professional identities? Do you use different platforms for different purposes? ‚úîÔ∏è Access and Inclusion How does the platform you chose for the Major Project incorporate accessibility and inclusion principles. How are disabled people treated on the platform? Are there multiple ways people can consume or produce content to meet accessibility needs? How do you include those who might otherwise be excluded? ‚úîÔ∏è Media Literacy, Trust, and Disinformation Does your chosen platform have content moderation policies? Does it flag disinformation, or provide links to trusted resources? How do you ensure that you don‚Äôt spread disinformation as misinformation? (Hint: this last question might require you to do a bit of legwork to learn about Media Literacy. This resource should help - but don‚Äôt try to read the whole thing!) You are encouraged to use your Wow and Wonder posts in these reflections.

Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age Reference Siemens, G. (2005). Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age. International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 2(1). Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age by George Siemens is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Introduction Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism are the three broad learning theories most often utilized in the creation of instructional environments. These theories, however, were developed in a time when learning was not impacted through technology. Over the last twenty years, technology has reorganized how we live, how we communicate, and how we learn. Learning needs and theories that describe learning principles and processes, should be reflective of underlying social environments. Vaill emphasizes that ‚Äúlearning must be a way of being ‚Äì an ongoing set of attitudes and actions by individuals and groups that they employ to try to keep abreast of the surprising, novel, messy, obtrusive, recurring events‚Ä¶‚Äù (1996, p.42). Learners as little as forty years ago would complete the required schooling and enter a career that would often last a lifetime. Information development was slow. The life of knowledge was measured in decades. Today, these foundational principles have been altered. Knowledge is growing exponentially. In many fields the life of knowledge is now measured in months and years. Gonzalez (2004) describes the challenges of rapidly diminishing knowledge life: ‚ÄúOne of the most persuasive factors is the shrinking half-life of knowledge. The ‚Äúhalf-life of knowledge‚Äù is the time span from when knowledge is gained to when it becomes obsolete. Half of what is known today was not known 10 years ago. The amount of knowledge in the world has doubled in the past 10 years and is doubling every 18 months according to the American Society of Training and Documentation (ASTD). To combat the shrinking half-life of knowledge, organizations have been forced to develop new methods of deploying instruction.‚Äù Some significant trends in learning: Many learners will move into a variety of different, possibly unrelated fields over the course of their lifetime. Informal learning is a significant aspect of our learning experience. Formal education no longer comprises the majority of our learning. Learning now occurs in a variety of ways ‚Äì through communities of practice, personal networks, and through completion of work-related tasks. Learning is a continual process, lasting for a lifetime. Learning and work related activities are no longer separate. In many situations, they are the same. Technology is altering (rewiring) our brains. The tools we use define and shape our thinking. The organization and the individual are both learning organisms. Increased attention to knowledge management highlights the need for a theory that attempts to explain the link between individual and organizational learning. Many of the processes previously handled by learning theories (especially in cognitive information processing) can now be off-loaded to, or supported by, technology. Know-how and know-what is being supplemented with know-where (the understanding of where to find knowledge needed). Background Driscoll (2000) defines learning as ‚Äúa persisting change in human performance or performance potential‚Ä¶[which] must come about as a result of the learner‚Äôs experience and interaction with the world‚Äù (p.11). This definition encompasses many of the attributes commonly associated with behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism ‚Äì namely, learning as a lasting changed state (emotional, mental, physiological (i.e.¬†skills)) brought about as a result of experiences and interactions with content or other people. Driscoll (2000, p14-17) explores some of the complexities of defining learning. Debate centers on: Valid sources of knowledge - Do we gain knowledge through experiences? Is it innate (present at birth)? Do we acquire it through thinking and reasoning? Content of knowledge ‚Äì Is knowledge actually knowable? Is it directly knowable through human experience? The final consideration focuses on three epistemological traditions in relation to learning: Objectivism, Pragmatism, and Interpretivism Objectivism (similar to behaviorism) states that reality is external and is objective, and knowledge is gained through experiences. Pragmatism (similar to cognitivism) states that reality is interpreted, and knowledge is negotiated through experience and thinking. Interpretivism (similar to constructivism) states that reality is internal, and knowledge is constructed. All of these learning theories hold the notion that knowledge is an objective (or a state) that is attainable (if not already innate) through either reasoning or experiences. Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism (built on the epistemological traditions) attempt to address how it is that a person learns. Behaviorism states that learning is largely unknowable, that is, we can‚Äôt possibly understand what goes on inside a person (the ‚Äúblack box theory‚Äù). Gredler (2001) expresses behaviorism as being comprised of several theories that make three assumptions about learning: Observable behaviour is more important than understanding internal activities Behaviour should be focused on simple elements: specific stimuli and responses Learning is about behaviour change Cognitivism often takes a computer information processing model. Learning is viewed as a process of inputs, managed in short term memory, and coded for long-term recall. Cindy Buell details this process: ‚ÄúIn cognitive theories, knowledge is viewed as symbolic mental constructs in the learner‚Äôs mind, and the learning process is the means by which these symbolic representations are committed to memory.‚Äù Constructivism suggests that learners create knowledge as they attempt to understand their experiences (Driscoll, 2000, p.¬†376). Behaviorism and cognitivism view knowledge as external to the learner and the learning process as the act of internalizing knowledge. Constructivism assumes that learners are not empty vessels to be filled with knowledge. Instead, learners are actively attempting to create meaning. Learners often select and pursue their own learning. Constructivist principles acknowledge that real-life learning is messy and complex. Classrooms which emulate the ‚Äúfuzziness‚Äù of this learning will be more effective in preparing learners for life-long learning. Limitations of Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism A central tenet of most learning theories is that learning occurs inside a person. Even social constructivist views, which hold that learning is a socially enacted process, promotes the principality of the individual (and her/his physical presence ‚Äì i.e.¬†brain-based) in learning. These theories do not address learning that occurs outside of people (i.e.¬†learning that is stored and manipulated by technology). They also fail to describe how learning happens within organizations Learning theories are concerned with the actual process of learning, not with the value of what is being learned. In a networked world, the very manner of information that we acquire is worth exploring. The need to evaluate the worthiness of learning something is a meta-skill that is applied before learning itself begins. When knowledge is subject to paucity, the process of assessing worthiness is assumed to be intrinsic to learning. When knowledge is abundant, the rapid evaluation of knowledge is important. Additional concerns arise from the rapid increase in information. In today‚Äôs environment, action is often needed without personal learning ‚Äì that is, we need to act by drawing information outside of our primary knowledge. The ability to synthesize and recognize connections and patterns is a valuable skill. Many important questions are raised when established learning theories are seen through technology. The natural attempt of theorists is to continue to revise and evolve theories as conditions change. At some point, however, the underlying conditions have altered so significantly, that further modification is no longer sensible. An entirely new approach is needed. Some questions to explore in relation to learning theories and the impact of technology and new sciences (chaos and networks) on learning: How are learning theories impacted when knowledge is no longer acquired in the linear manner? What adjustments need to made with learning theories when technology performs many of the cognitive operations previously performed by learners (information storage and retrieval). How can we continue to stay current in a rapidly evolving information ecology? How do learning theories address moments where performance is needed in the absence of complete understanding? What is the impact of networks and complexity theories on learning? What is the impact of chaos as a complex pattern recognition process on learning? With increased recognition of interconnections in differing fields of knowledge, how are systems and ecology theories perceived in light of learning tasks? An Alternative Theory Including technology and connection making as learning activities begins to move learning theories into a digital age. We can no longer personally experience and acquire learning that we need to act. We derive our competence from forming connections. Karen Stephenson states: ‚ÄúExperience has long been considered the best teacher of knowledge. Since we cannot experience everything, other people‚Äôs experiences, and hence other people, become the surrogate for knowledge. ‚ÄòI store my knowledge in my friends‚Äô is an axiom for collecting knowledge through collecting people (undated).‚Äù Chaos is a new reality for knowledge workers. ScienceWeek (2004) quotes Nigel Calder‚Äôs definition that chaos is ‚Äúa cryptic form of order‚Äù. Chaos is the breakdown of predictability, evidenced in complicated arrangements that initially defy order. Unlike constructivism, which states that learners attempt to foster understanding by meaning making tasks, chaos states that the meaning exists ‚Äì the learner‚Äôs challenge is to recognize the patterns which appear to be hidden. Meaning-making and forming connections between specialized communities are important activities. Chaos, as a science, recognizes the connection of everything to everything. Gleick (1987) states: ‚ÄúIn weather, for example, this translates into what is only half-jokingly known as the Butterfly Effect ‚Äì the notion that a butterfly stirring the air today in Peking can transform storm systems next month in New York‚Äù (p.¬†8). This analogy highlights a real challenge: ‚Äúsensitive dependence on initial conditions‚Äù profoundly impacts what we learn and how we act based on our learning. Decision making is indicative of this. If the underlying conditions used to make decisions change, the decision itself is no longer as correct as it was at the time it was made. The ability to recognize and adjust to pattern shifts is a key learning task. Luis Mateus Rocha (1998) defines self-organization as the ‚Äúspontaneous formation of well organized structures, patterns, or behaviors, from random initial conditions.‚Äù (p.3). Learning, as a self-organizing process requires that the system (personal or organizational learning systems) ‚Äúbe informationally open, that is, for it to be able to classify its own interaction with an environment, it must be able to change its structure‚Ä¶‚Äù (p.4). Wiley and Edwards acknowledge the importance of self-organization as a learning process: ‚ÄúJacobs argues that communities self-organize is a manner similar to social insects: instead of thousands of ants crossing each other‚Äôs pheromone trails and changing their behavior accordingly, thousands of humans pass each other on the sidewalk and change their behavior accordingly.‚Äù. Self-organization on a personal level is a micro-process of the larger self-organizing knowledge constructs created within corporate or institutional environments. The capacity to form connections between sources of information, and thereby create useful information patterns, is required to learn in our knowledge economy. Networks, Small Worlds, Weak Ties A network can simply be defined as connections between entities. Computer networks, power grids, and social networks all function on the simple principle that people, groups, systems, nodes, entities can be connected to create an integrated whole. Alterations within the network have ripple effects on the whole. Albert-L√°szl√≥ Barab√°si states that ‚Äúnodes always compete for connections because links represent survival in an interconnected world‚Äù (2002, p.106). This competition is largely dulled within a personal learning network, but the placing of value on certain nodes over others is a reality. Nodes that successfully acquire greater profile will be more successful at acquiring additional connections. In a learning sense, the likelihood that a concept of learning will be linked depends on how well it is currently linked. Nodes (can be fields, ideas, communities) that specialize and gain recognition for their expertise have greater chances of recognition, thus resulting in cross-pollination of learning communities. Weak ties are links or bridges that allow short connections between information. Our small world networks are generally populated with people whose interests and knowledge are similar to ours. Finding a new job, as an example, often occurs through weak ties. This principle has great merit in the notion of serendipity, innovation, and creativity. Connections between disparate ideas and fields can create new innovations. Connectivism Connectivism is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories. Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous environments of shifting core elements ‚Äì not entirely under the control of the individual. Learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an organization or a database), is focused on connecting specialized information sets, and the connections that enable us to learn more are more important than our current state of knowing. Connectivism is driven by the understanding that decisions are based on rapidly altering foundations. New information is continually being acquired. The ability to draw distinctions between important and unimportant information is vital. The ability to recognize when new information alters the landscape based on decisions made yesterday is also critical. Principles of connectivism: Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions. Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources. Learning may reside in non-human appliances. Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning. Ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill. Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities. Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision. Connectivism also addresses the challenges that many corporations face in knowledge management activities. Knowledge that resides in a database needs to be connected with the right people in the right context in order to be classified as learning. Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism do not attempt to address the challenges of organizational knowledge and transference. Information flow within an organization is an important element in organizational effectiveness. In a knowledge economy, the flow of information is the equivalent of the oil pipe in an industrial economy. Creating, preserving, and utilizing information flow should be a key organizational activity. Knowledge flow can be likened to a river that meanders through the ecology of an organization. In certain areas, the river pools and in other areas it ebbs. The health of the learning ecology of the organization depends on effective nurturing of information flow. Social network analysis is an additional element in understanding learning models in a digital era. Art Kleiner (2002) explores Karen Stephenson‚Äôs ‚Äúquantum theory of trust‚Äù which ‚Äúexplains not just how to recognize the collective cognitive capability of an organization, but how to cultivate and increase it‚Äù. Within social networks, hubs are well-connected people who are able to foster and maintain knowledge flow. Their interdependence results in effective knowledge flow, enabling the personal understanding of the state of activities organizationally. The starting point of connectivism is the individual. Personal knowledge is comprised of a network, which feeds into organizations and institutions, which in turn feed back into the network, and then continue to provide learning to individual. This cycle of knowledge development (personal to network to organization) allows learners to remain current in their field through the connections they have formed. Landauer and Dumais (1997) explore the phenomenon that ‚Äúpeople have much more knowledge than appears to be present in the information to which they have been exposed‚Äù. They provide a connectivist focus in stating ‚Äúthe simple notion that some domains of knowledge contain vast numbers of weak interrelations that, if properly exploited, can greatly amplify learning by a process of inference‚Äù. The value of pattern recognition and connecting our own ‚Äúsmall worlds of knowledge‚Äù are apparent in the exponential impact provided to our personal learning. John Seely Brown presents an interesting notion that the internet leverages the small efforts of many with the large efforts of few. The central premise is that connections created with unusual nodes supports and intensifies existing large effort activities. Brown provides the example of a Maricopa County Community College system project that links senior citizens with elementary school students in a mentor program. The children ‚Äúlisten to these ‚Äúgrandparents‚Äù better than they do their own parents, the mentoring really helps the teachers‚Ä¶the small efforts of the many- the seniors ‚Äì complement the large efforts of the few ‚Äì the teachers.‚Äù (2002). This amplification of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension of a personal network is the epitome of connectivism. Implications The notion of connectivism has implications in all aspects of life. This paper largely focuses on its impact on learning, but the following aspects are also impacted: Management and leadership. The management and marshalling of resources to achieve desired outcomes is a significant challenge. Realizing that complete knowledge cannot exist in the mind of one person requires a different approach to creating an overview of the situation. Diverse teams of varying viewpoints are a critical structure for completely exploring ideas. Innovation is also an additional challenge. Most of the revolutionary ideas of today at one time existed as a fringe element. An organizations ability to foster, nurture, and synthesize the impacts of varying views of information is critical to knowledge economy survival. Speed of ‚Äúidea to implementation‚Äù is also improved in a systems view of learning. Media, news, information. This trend is well under way. Mainstream media organizations are being challenged by the open, real-time, two-way information flow of blogging. Personal knowledge management in relation to organizational knowledge management Design of learning environments Conclusion The pipe is more important than the content within the pipe. Our ability to learn what we need for tomorrow is more important than what we know today. A real challenge for any learning theory is to actuate known knowledge at the point of application. When knowledge, however, is needed, but not known, the ability to plug into sources to meet the requirements becomes a vital skill. As knowledge continues to grow and evolve, access to what is needed is more important than what the learner currently possesses. Connectivism presents a model of learning that acknowledges the tectonic shifts in society where learning is no longer an internal, individualistic activity. How people work and function is altered when new tools are utilized. The field of education has been slow to recognize both the impact of new learning tools and the environmental changes in what it means to learn. Connectivism provides insight into learning skills and tasks needed for learners to flourish in a digital era. References Barab√°si, A.

Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement. First Monday. Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement by Dave S. White and Alison Le Cornu is marked with CC0 1.0 Abstract This article proposes a continuum of ‚ÄòVisitors‚Äô and ‚ÄòResidents‚Äô as a replacement for Prensky‚Äôs much‚Äêcriticised Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants. Challenging the basic premises upon which Prensky constructed his typology, Visitors and Residents fulfil a similar purpose in mapping individuals‚Äô engagement with the Web. We argue that the metaphors of ‚Äòplace‚Äô and ‚Äòtool‚Äô most appropriately represent the use of technology in contemporary society, especially given the advent of social media. The Visitors and Residents continuum accounts for people behaving in different ways when using technology, depending on their motivation and context, without categorising them according to age or background. A wider and more accurate representation of online behaviour is therefore established. Introduction ‚ÄòThe digital natives/digital immigrants distinction is dead or at least dying‚Äô. So proclaims Doug Holton in his blogpost. He continues: ‚ÄòUnfortunately, the idea is still uncritically accepted even in some journal articles, and perhaps used as an excuse or crutch too often for poor or ineffective teaching practices‚Äô. Holton is not alone in his criticism. McKenzie (2007) writes strongly against Prensky‚Äôs (2001a, b) typology identifying a number of ‚Äòthinly supported claims‚Äô, while Kennedy, et al.¬†(2010) demonstrate through an empirical research project that Prensky‚Äôs age‚Äìrelated hypothesis is very much less clear‚Äìcut than the Natives and Immigrants dichotomy implies. Our intention in this article is to propose an alternative, which we have termed ‚ÄòVisitors and Residents‚Äô. Prensky‚Äôs distinction between people who are entirely at ease within a digital environment and those who manage to learn to exist but who (in his view) will never be fully competent, has gained enormous currency and, until recently, widespread acceptance. Similarly, his linked assertion that the differentiation also signals the need for an educational revolution, requiring a new approach which accommodates the up‚Äìand‚Äìcoming Natives, has not only been largely believed but has provoked a sense of panic among ‚ÄòImmigrant educators‚Äô who now perceive themselves wrong‚Äìfooted and unable to step up to the plate. Prensky himself has expressed doubts over the validity of his thinking (Prensky, 2009). Nor is he the first to try and analyse perceived behaviours of learners by categorising them into types. The benefits of so doing, as well as the disadvantages, are well recognised: benefits are that these categories allow others to use this new knowledge to augment the learning experience; disadvantages focus principally on the inflexibility of types, as well as the tendency to box individuals into one type or another, overlooking contradictory evidence. Theories of learning styles favour typologies of this sort, as do certain theories of human development, and many struggle to allow individuals the space simultaneously to exhibit traits characteristic of different types. Why, then, would we want to propose an alternative to Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants? Firstly, we recognise the usefulness of these typologies, despite their drawbacks. Secondly, we feel that although many criticisms of Prensky are valid, he initiated an important dialogue and offered a framework which those concerned with the quality and effectiveness of education delivered electronically could use. He was one of the first to do this in a fast‚Äìmoving domain and this contribution should be acknowledged. His Natives and Immigrants were hypothetical children of their time, however, and we believe that as our understanding has developed, it is appropriate to re‚Äìevaluate what was previously accepted and to change it to suit the purposes of today. Not only so, but there are many instances ‚Äî to the point, perhaps, of being a general and widespread habit ‚Äî where Prensky‚Äôs ideas on Natives and Immigrants have been inappropriately transported into a social media context, paradoxically finding themselves as ‚Äòimmigrants‚Äô in a new land. We introduce our discussion in section II by critiquing Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants with a specific focus on the nature of the metaphor. The section also suggests that in the ten years since Prensky published his Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants (2001), technology, computer applications, and hence the way in which education takes place, have moved on to the point that the Native/Immigrant dichotomy is now redundant. In section III we explore new metaphors of tool, place and space, and, in section IV, therefore, we present our alternative which builds on yet replaces one of the underdeveloped strengths in Prensky‚Äôs typology using in particular, the metaphor of place. We make the assumption of familiarity with Prenky‚Äôs work and for that reason do not summarise it here [1]. Prensky‚Äôs Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants: A critique Metaphors: Language and age Key to Prensky‚Äôs typology is the connection he made between computing competence and age. In his original paper, he writes: What should we call these ‚Äúnew‚Äù students of today? Some refer to them as the N‚Äì[for Net]‚Äìgen or D‚Äì[for digital]‚Äìgen. But the most useful designation I have found for them is Digital Natives. Our students today are all ‚Äúnative speakers‚Äù of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet. So what does that make the rest of us? Those of us who were not born into the digital world but have, at some later point in our lives, become fascinated by and adopted many or most aspects of the new technology are, and always will be compared to them, Digital Immigrants The importance of the distinction is this: As Digital Immigrants learn ‚Äî like all immigrants, some better than others ‚Äî to adapt to their environment, they always retain, to some degree, their ‚Äúaccent,‚Äù that is, their foot in the past. The ‚Äúdigital immigrant accent‚Äù can be seen in such things as turning to the Internet for information second rather than first, or in reading the manual for a program rather than assuming that the program itself will teach us to use it. Today‚Äôs older folk were ‚Äúsocialized‚Äù differently from their kids, and are now in the process of learning a new language. And a language learned later in life, scientists tell us, goes into a different part of the brain. [2] Prensky‚Äôs language‚Äìbased analogy is compelling and it is easy to see why it quickly commanded attention. Recently, however, challenges have been mounted that separate the two dimensions and call into question, in particular, whether it is genuinely the case firstly that older learners are really as handicapped as Prensky suggests, and secondly that younger learners are as privileged as he understands them to be. Ten years on, evidence and logic challenge both positions, with, for example, comments such as the following from Bennett, et al.¬†(2008): Though limited in scope and focus, the research evidence to date indicates that a proportion of young people are highly adept with technology and rely on it for a range of information gathering and communication activities. However, there also appears to be a significant proportion of young people who do not have the levels of access or technology skills predicted by proponents of the digital native idea. Such generalisations about a whole generation of young people thereby focus attention on technically adept students. With this comes the danger that those less interested and less able will be neglected, and that the potential impact of socio‚Äìeconomic and cultural factors will be overlooked. It may be that there is as much variation within the digital native generation as between the generations. [3] Similarly, Margaryan and Littlejohn write: Many young students are far from being the epitomic global, connected, socially networked technologically‚Äìfluent digital native who has little patience for passive and linear forms of learning. While the use of technologies is limited in terms of the range and the nature, there is some evidence that younger students use some tools more actively than the older students, but neither of these two groups uses these technologies to support their learning effectively. Educators therefore cannot presume that all young students are ‚Äúdigital natives‚Äù who understand how to use technology to support and enhance their learning. [4] It is increasingly clear that, just as is the case for almost every subject discipline and expertise, some learners will acquire the requisite skills quickly, while others will struggle, regardless of age. It is also significant that formal bodies which regularly survey Internet use, such as Oxford Internet Surveys (OxIS), do not use specifically age‚Äìrelated categories for their data collection, but rather life‚Äìstage categories. The majority of OxIS 2009 surveys on The Internet in Britain focus on students, employed and retired people, making no inferences about any commensurate age‚Äìrelated dimensions. The implication is that each category is equally technologically competent, but their respective life‚Äìstage leads them to different types of use. For the purposes of this paper our goal is not to disprove Prensky‚Äôs thesis per se, but instead to challenge the underlying metaphor of language‚Äì and second‚Äìlanguage‚Äìlearning which he builds his case on, and then to offer an alternative. We want to ask questions such as: Can learning technological skills be likened to that of language learning? Is the analogy appropriate? If not, can another more appropriate metaphor be identified? It is undoubtedly significant that there has been a move towards speaking of digital literacies (rather than, for example, digital languages) in recent years. Lankshear and Knobel (2008) draw attention to the move from the singular ‚Äòliteracy‚Äô to the plural ‚Äòliteracies‚Äô, a move of which they approve on account of, amongst other things, &amp;rlsquo;the sheer diversity of specific accounts of ‚Äúdigital literacy‚Äù that exist, and consequent implications of that for digital literacy policies‚Äô [5]. They also provide a useful summary of the ways in which ‚Äòdigital literacy‚Äô has been interpreted and used. These include: Mastering ideas, not keystrokes (Bawden, 2008, citing Gilster, 1997) Conceptual definitions as distinct from standardized operational definitions (Lankshear and Knobel, 2006) Individuals‚Äô ability to participate in a multimodal culture (Jenkins, et al., 2006) Lankshear and Knobel conclude [6]: This sheer variety means that digital literacy can be seen as ‚Äúa framework for integrating various other literacies and skill‚Äìsets‚Äù without ‚Äúthe need to encompass them all‚Äù or to serve as ‚Äúone literacy to rule them all‚Äù (Martin cited in Bawden, Chapter 1 here; Martin, 2006). Equally, however, it reminds us that any attempt to constitute an umbrella definition or overarching frame of digital literacy will necessarily involve reconciling the claims of myriad concepts of digital literacy, a veritable legion of digital literacies. There are undoubtedly similarities between mastering this range of literacies and learning a second language, although research about precisely how people learn a new language in adulthood constitutes a complete field in its own right and cannot be explored here. Yet this still seems not to be Prensky‚Äôs principal focus. Instead, he targets the foreign accent which remains and which will always be the giveaway of someone‚Äôs background and origins. For him, the accent is a matter of habit or of first course of action. So, as the above quote demonstrates, the instinct not to go to the Internet (presumably in favour of using a paper‚Äìbased encyclopedia) when searching for information, or the tendency to read an instruction manual (also paper‚Äìbased) rather than work out how something functions by trial and error, are both recognisable ‚Äòaccents‚Äô. Once again, it is easy to challenge these assertions. Now that the Internet has been in widespread use in educational establishments for around 15 years, it has clearly become the source of information chosen first by seekers, regardless of age [7]. In many cases the Internet is now the sole up-to-date source of information, and certainly the sole source which offers much free‚Äìof‚Äìcharge. Secondly, reading an instruction manual for other tasks (assembling flat‚Äìpacked furniture, using a new piece of machinery for the first time, getting to know a new smart phone, etc.) is often a last resort once again for people of all ages. In this paper we demonstrate that that Prensky was: a) over hasty in appropriating an analogy which cannot bear the weight required of it; and, b) imprecise in his combination of diverse elements (second‚Äìlanguage learning, accent, habit and age, linking all these to brain development) which cannot be legitimately combined to make his case. We seek to propose an alternative, highlighting how the advent of social media has dramatically changed the terrain of computer‚Äìmediated education, which in turn has enabled us to place a different metaphor, that of ‚Äòplace‚Äô, at centre stage and offer the analogy of Visitors and Residents as alternatives to Digital Natives and Immigrants. Towards a new metaphor of engagement with online technology Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants pre‚Äìdate the launching of what are now commonly known as social media applications. The social bookmarking site Delicious, for example, was launched in 2003 as was MySpace. Both Facebook and World of Warcraft [8] launched in 2004; Bebo and YouTube in 2005; and, Twitter in 2006. Prior to 2003, the Internet was used primarily as a means of finding information with Google leading the way since 1997 in offering an effective means of searching for and gathering information. A key distinction between information‚Äìgathering versus social‚Äìnetworking sites is that the latter invite individuals to project their personas online as a ‚Äòdigital identity‚Äô via text, image and video. Furthermore, social media platforms facilitate the construction, by the individual, of complex social networks not constrained by physical geography. These are critical shifts in the use of the internet which we suggest are transforming the nature of relationships, citizenship and learning. In response to these changes the metaphors which we suggest best represent the engagement with online technology now widely experienced are those of ‚Äòtool‚Äô and ‚Äòplace/space‚Äô. This section looks at both. Certain platforms on the Web fit quite neatly under the metaphor of ‚Äòtool‚Äô, while others are more closely aligned to the metaphor of ‚Äòplace‚Äô. ‚ÄòTool‚Äô is functional and may provide a bridge between Prensky‚Äôs understanding of how people used computer technology and that which we propose. ‚ÄòPlace‚Äô, on the other hand, is social. Increasingly, the two overlap. The metaphors of tool, place and space Until recently, with the exception of gaming, computing was almost solely linked to ideas of efficiency and goal‚Äìorientated functionality. Only now are we witnessing the social appropriation of new computing technologies. Microsoft‚Äôs Office suite is an excellent example of this, as well as of the skills that people needed to use the applications effectively. Each application had ‚Äî and has ‚Äî a specific purpose that enabled users to do something. It functioned as a tool, a means to an end; users learned and practised skills, developing varying degrees of competence and confidence in achieving their desired ends. Despite numerous iterations of these platforms and of computing operating systems, a set of generally‚Äìaccepted principles of good practice emerged relating to what users needed and how they could access this most effectively, with the result that users could develop a set of transferable skills applicable across a range of platforms and become computer literate. In the abrupt cultural shift towards the construction of social networks, we argue that the analogies of language and age cease to function and believe that a metaphor of place is more fit for the purpose of understanding different behaviours and potentially aptitudes. The use of ‚Äòplace‚Äô as a metaphor to conceptualise the ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô nature of the Web is not new (see Johnston, 2009; Wenger, et al., 2009). However, our definition of place does not make a hard distinction between the virtual and the physical; on the contrary, we are proposing that place is primarily a sense of being present with others. A sense of social presence (White and Le Cornu, 2010) is something those who spend time on social media platforms experience to a high level, with the effect of foregrounding a broad sense of digital identity. This in turn results in a type of personification within social media spaces as people project aspects of their identity to an imagined audience (see Marwick and boyd, 2010). The social dimension of computing has brought about a paradigm shift in many individuals‚Äô experience of computer use as well as influenced their attitude and motivation towards the use and purpose of connected digital technologies. The metaphor of ‚Äòplace‚Äô is therefore one which lends itself very easily to the experience people have when they are engaged and interacting socially with others via a computer. It is not uncommon to hear people asking each other if they have ‚Äòbeen‚Äô ‚Äòin‚Äô to Facebook today, for example. One of the key features is the fact that people can still meet in an area common to all of them, and for that reason an impression of location and of social space is created. Just as physical, geographical places have architectural characteristics and town planners can make a real‚Äìlife city more, or less, user‚Äìfriendly to navigate, so software designers are responsible for the navigability of platforms, and Facebook users are familiar with the frustration of suddenly ‚Äòlosing their way‚Äô when the platform is upgraded and changed. In all of these experiences, the metaphors of space and place are used to describe what is going on. The distinction between and shift from people‚Äôs appropriation of computer programmes as tools to thinking of platforms as social spaces is clearly identifiable in an application such as Google Docs. In its original basic form, Google Docs offers a functional tool whereby users can create documents and make them available to others. While this is happening at an individual level, the application remains a tool. As soon as another person, or people, join in and participate in editing and sharing in the creation of the document, a social place is created. Users can reconsider their actions in a kind of social context, discussing with each other aspects of the document and experiencing a social dimension as well as functional. We therefore argue that tools, places and spaces are the three key metaphors that most aptly describe the experience of computer users in a world where social media are becoming more and more prevalent. We suggest that Prenksy‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äòplace‚Äô was limited and tagged to his principal metaphor of language; we are now suggesting that this metaphor should be appropriately contextualised and to occupy centre stage in any discussion about how people interact with each other and with content when both are electronically mediated, and be linked to the metaphor of tool. This then allows the formulation of a new typology, that of Visitors and Residents. These are explored in the next section. Visitors and Residents Visitors We propose that Visitors understand the Web as akin to an untidy garden tool shed. They have defined a goal or task and go into the shed to select an appropriate tool which they use to attain their goal. Task over, the tool is returned to the shed. It may not have been perfect for the task, but they are happy to make do so long as some progress is made. This is important, since Visitors need to see some concrete benefit resulting from their use of the platform. Significantly, Visitors are unlikely to have any form of persistent profile online which projects their identity into the digital space. They are anonymous, their activity invisible to all but the databases running the Web sites they use. Individuals who most closely fit the Visitor approach give a number of reasons for not wanting a ‚Äòdigital identity‚Äô which would persist in some form even when they were not online. Issues of privacy and fear of identity theft are paramount [9] but there is also a sense that social networking activities are banal and egotistical. Implicit in this is the idea that if you have a ‚Äòreal‚Äô social life and network of friends then you wouldn‚Äôt choose to socialise online in a visible manner. It is this visibility, or the ‚Äòbroadcast‚Äô nature of the visibility, which is key; Visitors are not averse to using e‚Äìmail or Skype to maintain relationships but they are wary of creating a Facebook profile. Visitors then see the Web as primarily a set of tools which deliver or manipulate content (this can include the content of a conversation because, as mentioned, they are happy to accept the Web as a useful conduit for interpersonal communication). This content is often distanced as far as possible from personal opinion (unless a competent authority is in evidence or a pre‚Äìexisting off‚Äìline relationship). In effect, the ‚Äònon‚Äìreferenced‚Äô or non‚Äìexpert opinion and notions such as the wisdom of the crowd are avoided. Ultimately to Visitors the Web is simply one of many tools they can use to achieve certain goals; it is categorised alongside the telephone, books, pen and paper and off‚Äìline software. It is not a ‚Äòplace‚Äô to think or to develop ideas and to put it crudely, and at its most extreme, Visitors do their thinking off‚Äìline. So Visitors are users, not members, of the Web and place little value in belonging online. Residents Residents, on the other hand, see the Web as a place, perhaps like a park or a building in which there are clusters of friends and colleagues whom they can approach and with whom they can share information about their life and work. A proportion of their lives is actually lived out online where the distinction between online and off‚Äìline is increasingly blurred. Residents are happy to go online simply to spend time with others and they are likely to consider that they ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to a community which is located in the virtual. They have a profile in social networking platforms such as Facebook or Twitter and are comfortable expressing their persona in these online spaces. To Residents, the Web is a place to express opinions, a place in which relationships can be formed and extended. While they use ‚Äòtools‚Äô such as online banking and shopping systems they also use the Web to maintain and develop a digital identity. Since they also undertake many of the activities that Visitors do, their residency is an additional layer of interaction and activity. When Residents log off, an aspect of their persona remains. This could be in many forms ranging from status updates to social networking platforms, to artefacts in media sharing sites or opinions expressed in blog posts or blog comments. Residents see the Web primarily as a network of individuals or clusters of individuals who in turn generate content. Value online is assessed in terms of relationships as well as knowledge. Residents do not make a clear distinction between concepts of content and of persona. A blog post is as much an expression of identity as it is a discussion of particular ideas. The fact that Wikipedia has been authored collectively is not a concern, what is important is how relevant the information they find is to their particular needs. Discussion Our Visitors and Residents typology should be understood as a continuum and not a binary opposition. Individuals may be able to place themselves at a particular point along this continuum rather than in one of two boxes. Nor is a predominantly Visitor approach necessarily any less effective or of less value than a predominantly Resident approach since the value of either has to be set against a given context and set of goals. Similarly, we do not consider the Visitor to be necessarily any less technically adept than the Resident. The concept of ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô aptitude should be viewed as more than simply an ability to manipulate hardware and software. It is more useful to think of the ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô as extending into skill sets required by a given discipline, such as the ability to research a given topic. This definition of the technical then intersects with the notion of digital literacy which is a more useful framework to assess the value of given approaches, the relative merits of which are discussed in reports such as Beetham, et al.‚Äôs (2009) LLiDA project and Gillen and Barton‚Äôs (2010) Digital literacies (PDF). A simple reading of this typology might lead one to believe that the category of Visitor is somehow a subset of that of Resident or that the goal of Visitors should be to extend their skills towards the Resident end of the continuum. Stoerger (2009) introduces this idea in her ‚Äòdigital melting pot‚Äô analogy by suggesting that Web users with a range of competencies can simply learn from each other by mingling in shared spaces on the Web. This does not take into account the motivation behind a type of engagement with the Web, however, and assumes, again, that technical aptitude is directly linked to being ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô in the online environment. Nevertheless, it is often much more efficient to research a particular topic in such a way that meets the needs of traditional educational requirements (essays, exams) if a Visitor approach is taken. Visitors‚Äô technical and intellectual skills in the pursuit of specific content may well be significantly more sophisticated than Residents‚Äô, regardless of their age (and here we specifically challenge Prensky‚Äôs belief that older people will never achieve as high a degree of technical aptitude as younger people). Similarly it has been suggested that aptitude in social media platforms often does not translate into other online spaces or tools (Stoerger, 2009), although this is difficult to quantify. Residents‚Äô ability to engage with ‚Äònew‚Äô platforms in ways in which appear culturally novel or radical does not equip them to negotiate Wikipedia or an online library catalogue successfully either in terms of functionality or the literacy skills required. The literacy required is not simply one of off‚Äìline/online or gamer/non‚Äìgamer; online literacies differ between platforms, although to an outsider the skills required may seem equivalent and there is a certain commonality in the acquisition of transferable skills. However, the notion of social networking platforms masks the fact that for many ‚Äòexpert‚Äô Facebook users Twitter is relatively undecipherable. At one level this can be accounted for by the difference in functionality, but it also relates to the literacies required for the respective platforms, together with the motivation. The two platforms serve quite different purposes. It would be easy simply to categorise individuals at a particular point along the Visitor/Resident continuum with some indication of their potential direction of travel. This labelling of individuals as a single type or as representing a single form of behaviour is where, as mentioned earlier, the nature of a typology can fall down. As Wenger (1998) has highlighted, we are all members of multiple communities and have to negotiate our roles and identities as we navigate the ‚Äònexus‚Äô of communities we belong to. In a similar manner an individual‚Äôs approach to the Web is likely to change dependent on context. For example, an individual might take a Resident approach in their private life but a Visitor approach in their role as a professional. Similarly it is not unusual for someone in a leadership role in a special interest group to manage that responsibility in a Resident style online while in a personal or professional context they choose to act as a Visitor. Individuals are generally very good at managing their differing approaches across contexts and have much experience of similar shifts in attitude and motivation as they move between roles played out in physical spaces. However, the ubiquity of the Web across these traditional physical boundaries is beginning to pose challenges, blurring the boundaries of traditional contexts, which Marwick and boyd (2010) describe as ‚Äòcontext collapse‚Äô. A good example of this is the Visitor tutor/academic whose rather more Resident personal life is discovered by their students. There is growing evidence (e.g., boyd, 2008; Helsper and Eynon, 2009; Tenopir and Rowlands, 2007; CiBER, 2007) that while age may be less of a factor in technology use than Prensky envisaged, factors such as conceptions of privacy and the notions of friendship may be shifting generationally. In fact the cultural effects of the social hyperconnectivity brought about by social media and mobile devices are often masked by shallow assessments of technological functionality and the apparent capability of specific groups in consuming ‚Äònew‚Äô technology. Conclusion We propose that our Visitors and Residents paradigm not only describes the lived experience and practice of technological engagement in a more accurate way than Prensky‚Äôs Natives and Immigrants, but it is based on a more secure foundation. Our typology of Visitors and Residents turn to the metaphor of place to provide an analytic framework, but the strength of moving away from language and accent and placing the emphasis on motivation allows for a wide variety of practices which span all age groups and does not require individuals to be boxed, inexorably, in one category or the other. Both ‚Äòplace‚Äô and ‚Äòtool‚Äô have the capacity to incorporate motivation. Questions such as: ‚ÄòWhat am I going there for?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhat am I hoping to achieve?‚Äô, ‚ÄòWhich place best serves my purpose?‚Äô, ‚ÄòHow long do I intend to stay?‚Äô, ‚ÄòHave I got the skills that I need?‚Äô and ‚ÄòAm I happy to be on my own, or would I prefer to be in company?‚Äô all fit within the Visitors and Residents paradigm and transcend issues such as age, technological ‚Äògeekishness‚Äô, and the development of the brain, while still recognising that individuals may have a greater or less well developed natural aptitude for using technology and that some may never move (we avoid the term ‚Äòprogress‚Äô) beyond a low‚Äìlevel engagement of selecting a small range of tools for a limited number of purposes. Another strength of the paradigm is our understanding of it as a continuum along the lines of that depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Visitors and Residents Clearly, some people may operate entirely as Visitors, visiting specific Web places for specific purposes, entirely on their own and never leaving a footprint behind. At the other extreme, ‚Äòtotal‚Äô Residents (equally small in number, we suggest) spend all their online time in social interaction, never using the Internet for information‚Äìgathering yet leaving behind significant evidence of their presence. More representative of the majority of Internet use is that which takes place within the central box. Individuals move around the box, sometimes functioning more as Visitors, sometimes more as Residents, according to their motivation. Prensky made a deliberate connection between his Natives and Immigrants and people‚Äôs learning styles, preferences, and ultimately, abilities. Our Visitors and Residents paradigm also has educational implications that we have been unable to explore in this paper, but which we do in a following paper. In this, we shall look at understanding and setting expectations, practical aspects to bear in mind when engaging students online (especially when dealing with a large cohort, which is often the case), and explore some of the ways in which Visitors and Residents interacts with current understandings of and calls for digital literacy.
