Click the link to the current week in the ToC to navigate to the current updates. Week One (Jan 10-16) Hello everyone and thank you for joining this course! My name is Colin Madland and I will be your instructor for this Spring 2022 cohort of EDCI 338, Social Media and Personalized Learning. I am a PhD candidate in the Educational Technology area of the Faculty of Education, where I am researching assessment in higher education. You can learn more about me and my research on my personal website and follow me on Twitter. I live and work in West Kelowna, BC, on the traditional, unceded, ancestral lands of the syilx people and I am grateful to be a guest here. When I am not working on my reasearch, or my day-job at another BC university, I really enjoy riding my bicycle, cooking all sorts of deliciousness on my grill, and hanging out with my family, which includes my wife, 2 two sons, 1 daughter-in-law, 1 daughter, 1 son-in-law, and 1 grandson. Some people might include the fur-bearing beasts (a dog and a cat) in the ‘family’ category, I know they certainly do! I’m going to be honest with you (hopefully that isn’t surprising…) and perhaps a bit vulnerable. I’m teaching EDCI338 for the first time this spring, and the course requires a significant investment in learning to use some technologies that you and I both may not be entirely familiar with. There aren’t really any good ways to think deeply about social media without actually engaging in social media. That can be really challenging, especially in the midst of the ongoing dispruption of our lives due to COVID-19. Disruption can take many forms, from being physically sick with COVID, to having family members and friends being affected, to losing jobs, and on and on. As a result, it can be really hard to focus on learning. So, I want you to understand from the very beginning that it is my *responsibility- in this course to do whatever it is that I can to support your success. 💯 My commitment to you… I am committed to helping you achieve success in this course, and I trust you to contact me if you have questions or concerns. I hope you will find that you are welcome to approach me through whatever media I’ve published. Admittedly, sometimes I miss notifcations, but that is not on you. I encourage you to be persistent if you haven’t heard a reply after a day or so. Getting Going During this first week, it will be important to start getting comfortable with a couple of the tools we will use for the course. There is a WordPress Setup and a GitHub Setup page with instructions for how to get started with those two tools. It will be important for you to get started with these tools as they will be critical to your work in the course. I have created a poll to help us decide on a weekly meeting time, but for this week, let’s meet at 9:00am Pacific time in Zoom at the link that I sent in the announcement from Brightspace Things To Do This Week ✔️ Read the syllabus, which will be posted in Brightspace early this week. ✔️ Sign up for a WordPress site. ✔️ Register for a GitHub account. ✔️ Visit the course repo on Github and create a Learner Profile issue (click Issues to get going…). ✔️ Sign up for hypothes.is and join the edci338 private group. ✔️ Annotate the Course Details and Assessment pages with your questions, comments, concerns, or other observations. Week One - Wednesday, Jan 12 It’s good to see you starting to register your WordPress sites, signing up for GitHub (BTW, don’t choose a paid plan!), and submitting your first issue to the ‘Learner Profiles.’ You can see others who have submitted their issues as well at this link. While you are there, you can click on your own issue and add a label to align yourself with a Learning Pod. Screenshot of adding a label to a Github issue Also, in the EDCI338 repository that you created in your own account, please go to ‘Settings,’ then ‘Manage access,’ and click the green ‘Add people’ button and add me as a collaborator to your repository. My GitHub username is cmadland. Since the Learner Profile issues you created in the course repo are public to the course, we will use your own private repository to track your work and have assessment conversations. Manage access to a repository in GitHub. ✨ ProTip It is perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed or intimidated at the beginning of a course. EDCI338 has a bunch of front-loaded set up in technologies, and that always takes time. Please be patient with yourself and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need assistance. Week One Mini Update - Thursday GitHub In the spirit of learning together, I’ve learned that I need to add you as collaborators on the course repository in order for you to use your Learner Profile issues to organize Learning Pods. Those of you who have created your Learner Profiles in GitHub as of 4:45pm on Thursday have been invited as collaborators and should see an email in your inbox with the invitation. Once you are a collaborator, you will be able to add the Learning Pod label to your profile.. Weekend Update 1 …not that Weekend Update. Happy Saturday, at least I hope it is for you! For those of you in Victoria, stay away from the beaches for a bit until the tsunami warning is lifted! As of this morning, 19 of you have signed up for a GitHub account and created your Learner Profile in the course repository. Thank you for doing that. I know that everyone has different schedules, and in the past, most learners in my online classes do most of the work over the weekend. I anticipate a good number of you will be able to get going today and tomorrow. Just a reminder that you won’t be able to add the learning pod label to your learner profile until after I have added you as a collaborator in the repo. So far, I have added everyone who has submitted a Learner Profile issue, but there are a few of you who have not accepted that invitation. You can see the invitation if you sign in to Github and visit the course repo. There will be a blue notice towards the top of the page. As I mentioned previously, it really is important to get a good start becoming familiar with the technologies we will be using this term. Technology is a significant part of the *content- of this course, not just the medium for communication. If you are having challenges, please reach out to me as soon as possible! I’ve published in Brightspace (look in the Content navigator) a link you can use to book an appointment. I encourage you to book as a learning pod or as an individual. Good to see several of you annotating the course book using Hypothes.is! While you are welcome to post publicly, I have created a private group for EDCI338 if you would prefer to use that. Check out ‘Things to do this week.’ You will notice that there are several points in the course book where the text is highlighted, as below: hypothes.is annotations These are annotations using hypothes.is and you can access the tool by clicking the little arrow in the top right corner of the course book. hypothes.is access Then when the overlay opens, you’ll be able to sign in or sign up to annotate the page. Hypothes.is is active throughout the book, so you can use it to ask questions about any page…even this one. If you do that, then answers to your questions will ba available to the whole class. Wins all around! 🕐 Class Meeting Times The class meeting time poll has closed and the most popular time (8 votes out of 14 people who voted) was 1:00pm on Fridays - Click to see a time Zone Converter . I usually like to meet earlier in the week, but I’m happy to fit the course schedule and rhythm to what works for most of you. Please let me know if you or your learning pod need to connect! I’m happy to make time for you. I’ll end with this… JodyVance on Twitter Direct Link Have a good weekend! Week Two (Jan 17-23) Thank you all for your work over this first week to get started with both WordPress and GitHub, and a bit of hypothes.is. Over the next couple days, I will get your blog links and feeds set up on the course hub so that you’ll be able to find each others’ thoughts and reflections. I have sent invitations to everyone who has submitted a Learner Profile issue on the course repository. If you haven’t yet completed that task, please do so as soon as possible this week to ensure you can join a Learning Pod. This week, we will begin looking at, thinking about, talking about and reflecting on what it means to be a participant in this “gnarly hairball,” as danah boyd writes, of a digital culture we live in. We are interconnected in ways that we neither recognize nor give assent to, yet there are those who argue that we can use these same connections to derive significant relational value with other people. Social media is evolving tremendously rapidly (TikTok is only 5 years old and is already forcing YouTube and Instagram to change their approaches), and in many ways, careful thought about the implications of all this has not been at the forefront. We will think a bit about the importance of both building a network of allies and also the challenges of TMI (too much information). Week 2 Readings To get started, here are four articles and blog posts you should read: What is a Personal Learning Network? What are Personal Learning Networks? Understanding Personal Learning Networks Networked Privacy Please read these articles and then engage in some thinking in light of them during the following activities: Things To Do This Week ✔️ Read the four articles above. ✔️ Individually, use this Canva template, (or download the Venn Diagram image below, or draw your own) to think about how and why you participate in networked public spaces (the bottom-left circle), and how those ideas interact with your offline life (bottom-right circle), and with some other sphere of your life (top circle). You do not need to publish this, although you are welcome to, so the intent is to get you thinking about how the various circles of influence in your life interact, overlap, or maybe conflict. ✔️ Meet with your learning pod, ideally before the class meeting on Friday (1:00 Pacific Time) to discuss any questions you had about the readings or the Venn diagram activity. Feel free also to connect with each other about what social media tools you are particularly interested in. ✔️ Publish your first Wow and Wonder post on your WordPress blog. Make sure that your blog link is in your Learner Profile issue on the course repo and that you use the category edci338. ✔️ Meet in the course Zoom link (published in Brightspace) on Friday at 1:00 pm, Pacific time. Downloadable Venn Diagram Template Weekend Update 2 Welcome to the weekend! I trust that you will be productive, unplugged, connected to support, rested, or whatever you need in whatever measure you require. It was good to meet with about a third of you on Friday at 1:00 Pacific time. We were able to connect on some questions and get some more detail about using GitHub to manage your work in this course. Fortunately, I remembered to record the shareable parts of the meeting and post the recording to Brightspace under ‘Zoom Recordings’. Feel free to have a look. There are a few of you who have joined from the waitlist in the last few days, so welcome to you! It will be important for you to review the updates from Week 1 in order to catch up to others in the class. Please let me know if you have questions! Hopefully, by the end of tomorrow (Sunday) you will have read the four articles listed under Week 2 Readings and met with your Learning Pod to discuss the readings, the Venn diagram activity, or any technical questions you might have so far. 💭 Remember It is critical for you to stay in contact with either me or your Learning Pod or both if you are having difficulties! I recognize that there is a heavy technology lift at the beginning of this course, but I am confident that you can learn the workflow. It will be important for all of you to have completed all of the technology set-up tasks in GitHub and WordPress as we will be using GitHub more next week. Week Three (Jan 24 - 30) In Week 3, we are going to dive a bit more deeply into thinking about how you choose to present yourself in digital spaces, where you have control over that, and what you might do to regain control where it is lacking. Hopefully you recall the goals of the course, which include you being able to explain personalized learning and its relation to learning theory, and recognize that the Internet is not a neutral or equal space for everyone. You also should recall that your culminating post for this course, your Celebration of Learning, will require you to demonstrate how you have met each of the outcomes for the course. As such, it’s not too early to get started on your Celebration of Learning post as a draft on your site. Agency When you have the freedom and ability to take some specific action, it is often said that you have agency in that action. Unfortunately, in life, education, and social media, we sometimes lack agency. Compliance Tweet Link to Tweet Part of what I hope you will gain or develop in this course is a greater sense of agency over your interactions in digital spaces, whether they be networked and public, or not, and especially with respect to the technologies you might want or be required to use for your university education. Networked learning spaces have presented challenges for traditional models of university education, which has grown out of a long and very stable tradition that prioritizes lectures and the transmission of knowledge from the expert to the novice. Contrary to the transmission model, a networked model prioritizes the interactions between nodes in the network as the work of learning happens. In 2005, George Siemens wrote an influential article in which he outlined a vision of a learning theory for a networked time, which he called connectivism. One key argument in the theory of connectivism is that knowledge resides not only in individuals, but in the connections between individuals and that knowledge can be accessed through interactions between them. This is why this course is structured the way it is. By having you work in Learning Pods, rather than as individuals, and having you reference each other’s posts, it is intended that you will begin to realize the creation of a networked community. Further, by using GitHub and WordPress, which are both designed with features that enable and encourage lasting connections, rather than Brightspace, which is designed for short-term connections (at best), I hope that you, as a collective, will build a productive and supportive community of learners. Safety and Equity As a cis-gendered straight white male, I recognize that, if life were a video game (it’s not, and I don’t mean to trivialize the very real challenges we all face), I would be playing the game on the easiest level. I would have all the cheat codes, my challenges would be eminently attainable, and I would be able to breeze through the game with relative ease and comfort. Others, however, such as members of the LGBTQ+ community, Black or Indigenous people, disabled people, women and especially people who live at the intersection of more than one of those communities are all ‘playing’ under far more challenging conditions, especially online. As such, many open source software communities have adopted community codes of conduct to ensure that all people have equitable opportunities to participate and contribute to the knowledge of the community. As the open education community has emerged from the open source software community, we too have adopted this practice. In the context of EDCI338, we are going to use this week to consider our own Code of Conduct. To do so, we will start to use the capabilities of GitHub a little more deeply. In GitHub, you can go to the ‘Insights’ tab, and then choose ‘Network,’ where you will see a Network graph, as below (it will be a bit different when you see it as I will have committed changes since then). Github Network Graph In the graph, you can see that there are two ‘branches’ in the repository. A repository begins with only one branch, called main, but users can create branches, or copies, of the main branch in order to test features in the software, or ideas in the course, as it may be. You can see that this repository has two branches, the main branch (white, on the top), and a second branch called dev (green, on the bottom). The white line that drops down from main to dev on Jan 22 is when I merged the two branches by pushing changes I had made in main (the white dots) to dev so that the two branches were the same. I did this through a process called a pull request, or PR. By the time you see these instructions, I will have pushed changes from main to dev again, but dev will be ahead of main because I will have made changes on dev and started a pull request. The PR is the suggested addition of a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct I am suggesting is based on (or forked from) other open source codes, but it doesn’t quite fit for application in a course (I think). Our primary task for this week will be to review the pull request and come to a decision (maybe a consensus, maybe not) about how to proceed. We might choose to revise the code, accept it as is, or create a completely new one…but we shouldn’t proceed without one. To see the pull request, sign in to Github and click the ‘Pull requests’ tab in the menu just below the title of the repository. You will see that there will be one open pull request for you to click on. Once in the PR interface, you will be able to scroll down the page to see an overview of the proposed changes. You can get a more detailed view if you click ‘Files changed,’ which will show you a split view of the old file on the left, with deletions in red, and the new file on the right, with additions in green. GitHub Split Screen View of Proposed Changes In the split view, you can hover over one of the lines in the view to see a blue square with a white + sign. Clicking this plus sign will allow you to make a comment about that particular line. On the ‘Conversation’ tab, there is space for a discussion of the PR as a whole at the bottom of the page. Caution The course book at cmadland.github.io/edci338-202201 is being served to the web from the main branch, so it will be important that you follow the instructions below carefully! GitHub Sign in to GitHub. Click ‘Pull requests’ and find the Code of Conduct PR. Click Files changed and read through the proposed Code of Conduct. Leave comments or questions at points that you think we need to clarify, delete, or maybe revise. I have assigned one Reviewer from each Learning Pod who will act as the official approver of the code for that particular learning pod, so make sure you come to some sort of agreement. Leave overall questions and comments on the discussion at the bottom of the Conversation tab. After we have discussed any of the issues you might find, I will merge the PR into the main branch and the code of conduct will come into effect. As always, please make sure you get in touch with me if you are having challenges! Things To Do This Week ✔️ All the things from weeks one and two. ✔️ Read the Siemens article. ✔️ Read and comment on the GitHub pull request as described above. ✔️ Publish your second Wow and Wonder on your blog. To clarify a bit…this should be a short post that describes one thing that struck you as important (Wow), and one question that you have (Wonder). Your Wow and wonder posts are required but not graded and they should serve as conversation starters in your Learning Pod meetings. ✔️ If you are not yet connected with a Learning Pod or showing on the Blog List page on the course hub, please contact me as soon as possible! Week Four (Jan 31 - Feb 6) Week four already! I trust you are finding your way in this course as we begin to dig more deeply into what it means to build and maintain a PLN and to interact well in social media environments. These first few weeks, we have been building connections in a few different ways: **Asynchronously*- as I publish and you read updates here on the course book site. **Asynchronously*- in Github as I provide some tasks for you and you work to complete those tasks. As of today, everyone should have an invitation to collaborate on the course repository, create a Learner Profile issue, add a label and comment on a pull request. You are welcome to use GitHub to create issues as a group and assign those to me. Doing this will allow the whole class to get answers to common questions rather than those answers being tied up in emails. I have created a ‘question’ label that you can add to these issues. **Synchronously*- as we meet in Zoom each Friday at 1:00 PM pacific time to discuss the course. Keep in mind, these meetings are optional and I (usually) record the important parts for your viewing pleasure. **Synchronously*- in your Learning Pods as you meet on your own time and schedule in a smaller group of people. The Learning Pods are intended to be a spot to ask questions of each other, review your wow and wonder posts, and will become your group for building the Major Project. Hopefully, you will begin to realize the beginnings of a PLN within the community of EDCI338. I am often asked by learners who they should follow on social media, and my first recommendation is always that they should follow their classmates as building a PLN among the people you go to school with can be tremendously powerful over the years after you graduate. This week, we look at some issues related to privacy and how that might influence how you choose to share your life and world with web tools. Many people have had the experience of having to click through an End User License Agreement (EULA) in order to use a service. Far- fewer people have actually read what that EULA actually says, and part of that is by design. Those Terms of Service- or EULAs are loooooong and filled with legal language, and much of the most important language is in ALL CAPS, which makes the text much more difficult to read. Digital Privacy It is second nature to most to take selfies and share them on Instagram, Snapchat, etc., but once you move into the role of an educator in either a public or private context, you must adhere to the laws set out by the B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner. Their office has put together guidelines for both public bodies and private bodies. TWU, as a private body is not held to the same standard as public bodies, but we should strive to meet the same standard. The guidelines for public bodies to better understand what the rules are is linked below and how to get consent is detailed on page 4 of the BC Cloud Computing Guidelines (PDF) and you can review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act here.. TWU also has a privacy policy, available here. Each public body will have their own process (which may range from not allowing tools to pressure to integrate networked learning tools from outside of Canada), so it is important to understand your own setting and the law. You may find some administrators or staff breaking these rules or not aware of them. It is important for you to enter your field and uphold the law, regardless of the culture you enter. This does not mean that you do not engage online or outside of Canada. It means that if/when you do so, that you understand the steps, which are not much more complex than the consent you would get normally for going “on the Internet,” as is described in most settings, but you must name the date consent is effective and, if applicable, the date it expires. It is important that you work with your school district on the consent process. You can see an example of how K-12 school districts are addressing access to cloud tools outside of Canada here (Coquitlam) and here plus here (Victoria). You must also name each tool individually. It cannot be “blogging.” You must name WordPress.com or Blogger, etc. If you use Flipgrid, you must name Flipgrid. Consent must also be informed, so effort must be taken to ensure that those signing consent understand the implications – that their data may leave Canada, how it may be harvested, and to know about the U.S. Patriot Act. One archived resource by the Canadian Treasury Board provides significant detailed information about the Patriot Act here. It is helpful to also review section 4(b) of the B.C. Digital Literacy Framework which is applicable K12 contexts but helpful for others. Additional resources can be found here: Privacy Education for Kids by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Information Security Awareness by the BC Government MediaSmarts: Canada’s Centre for Digital and Media Literacy FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Competencies Learners should ensure that they: - Are aware of the OIPC, FIPPA, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines and follow them - Understand what constitutes personal information - Understand that privacy online is a personal choice and must be respected - Understand if that you assume an “educator” hat, you have a duty for those under your care, their parents and families, and your colleagues with regard to their privacy and protection of personal information - Are aware that the Canadian federal government states that the chances are remote that the US Patriot Act will access personal information of Canadians, but recognizes that it is our responsibility to protect privacy preferences and to ensure that consent obtained is informed consent. Some families may be involved with restraining orders and need to be private for their safety, but the reasons for privacy may be preference. Either way, it is not our business as to the reasons for privacy preferences, but it is our responsibility to uphold preferences. - Understand how media moves through networks into US cloud-based services (e.g., back-ups on iTunes, syncing with Dropbox, messages with personal information is sent on Gmail, Google Docs, blog RSS subscriptions, etc.) - Understand that these acts do not prohibit participation in networked tools outside of Canada and many public bodies are in need of staff and leaders who model networked literacy and positive citizenship online for their community - Understand what appropriate consent looks like for public bodies and is aware of what alternative steps are to support learners when consent is not obtained. Residents and Visitors We will also explore a bit the idea of Visitors- and Residents- in digital spaces. You have likely heard that younger generations are digital natives, while older generations are *digital immigrants- indicating that younger people are totally at ease with technology since they grew up with it, while oder generations have difficulty with technology. I’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor- in some web spaces and a resident- in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving. Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you- reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it’s any number of social sites like Instagram, TikTok, SnapChat and others. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present*. At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use. This video explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins). I’ve shared my VR Diagram below…keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there. Visitor-Resident Diagram [OPTIONAL] If you don’t already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called *Teaching in Higher Ed- by Bonni Stachowiak, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents. Digital Visitors and Residents, with David White - Teaching in Higher Ed Things To Do This Week ✔️ Complete the Privacy, Ethics &amp; Security in Digital Spaces Developing Awareness of Privacy quiz (not that kind of quiz…). ✔️ Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ✔️ Complete your own *Visitor/Resident- map and share and discuss it with your Learning Pod. You can use the tool that is provided here (DON’T forget to screenshot it, or you’ll lose it!), or use a different tool like Canva.com ✔️ Publish your third Wow and Wonder post based on your Visitor/Resident map and what you learned about privacy. ✔️ [Optional] Consider in your Wow and Wonder post what a potential employer might find based on your map if you applied for a job with them. ✔️ Set up a time with your Learning Pod to meet with me sometime this week. Please use the link published in BrightSpace, or submit an issue in Github. ✔️ Looking forward, your first Showcase post, based on one of your Wow and Wonder posts, is due at the end of next week (February 13). Major Project Update Good morning/afternoon/evening! I trust you are all well. This update will provide a mechanism to get you started on the Major Project. As a reminder, the major project is worth 40% of your final grade and will require some sustained effort over the second half of the course. I will be publishing details of the project as it unfolds on the Major Project page starting today. Week Five (February 7-13) Proximity creates empathy. ~Joel In last Friday’s class meeting (which is now posted in Brightspace), we talked about some of the forces at work in social media platforms and there was good conversation about hegemony, marginalization, and polarization as all being active forces, even though they are often opposing forces (hegemony means that everyone tends towards sameness, while polarization means that two or more groups of people become more and more different from the other groups). As we think about the idea of inclusion this week, I challenge you to consider who is included in your social media circles? Who do you follow or engage with? Who follows you? If the people you follow and the people who follow you are all the same people, and you all think alike, that can be comforting, but you may not be getting a complete picture of life. It can be challenging, yet important, to intentionally engage with people who are not like you. A great example of being intentional about engaging with people who are not like you is Mr. Rogers when he invited Officer Clemmons to share his wading pool in 1969 at a time in the US when most swimming pools were still segregated. Mr. Rogers set an example by inviting a Black man to join him in his wading pool. As you meet with your learning pod this week and talk about inclusion and diversity in your PLN, you might want to consider some of the following questions: How diverse is your existing PLN? In your PLN, are you learning from a variety of voices or are you the loudest in the room? Do you participate in a silo of information sharing (similar themes or wide range of interests)? How can you use a diverse PLN to broaden your views of inclusion? In your professional setting of choice, do you think inclusion is actively embraced? What is the learning outcome of your PLN and how are you ensuring your exposure to diversity and inclusion? How has your thinking about inclusion and PLN evolved after reviewing the videos and readings? Things To Do This Week ✔️ Read Pages 6-12 of One without the other: Stories of unity through diversity and inclusion by Shelley Moore and Leyton Schnellert. The link will require a UVic Library sign-in. ✔️ Watch Shelley Moore: Transforming Inclusive Education ✔️ Watch The Evolution of Inclusion ✔️ Watch a few more of Shelley Moore’s videos (most of them are 5 mins or less) or listen to some of her podcast interview (also available in her Youtube channel). Follow your interests on this. ✔️ Consider how Shelley uses various social media platforms to share her message and engage with the public. You might want to write a Wow of Wonder about this… ✔️ Publish your Week 5 Wow and Wonder post. ✔️ Publish your first Showcase post. You can base your Showcase post on one of your own Wow and Wonder posts, someone else’s Wow and Wonder post, or a combination of both. You could even post about something not covered in a Wow and Wonder post. Check the details of the requirements of the post at the link above, and try to get it finished for Sunday, Feb 13. Please let me know if you are having difficulties publishing your post. ✔️ Sign Up to claim a social media platform with your Learning Pod. Instructions are on the Major Project page. Week Six (Feb❤️14 - 20) Showcase Posts Thank you to those who have sent links to their first showcase post. You don’t need to send a link, but it would be helpful if you add the ‘showcase’ category to your showcase posts so I can easily find them and check to ensure that your blog is linked from the Learner Blogs page on the course hub. Also, please let me know if I need to update anything on that page. Some people have asked about commenting on other peoples’ posts, and yes, you should comment on other peoples’ posts. There are two ways that I recommend doing this. Include an inline link to someone’s post. For example, if I was wanting to comment on Shaafi’s Wow and Wonder Post 4, I would just select the text I want to link and click the ‘hyperlink’ tool to add the url of his site, https://shaafij.opened.ca/wow-and-wonder-post-4-week-5-feb-7-feb-13/. Paste the url for Shaafi’s post on its own line and without hyperlinking it. Normally, this will create an embedded preview in your post. The url will look like this: https://shaafij.opened.ca/wow-and-wonder-post-4-week-5-feb-7-feb-13/ And the preview will look like this in WordPress: Embedded Preview in WordPress Tracking and Feedback To aid in tracking your progress in the course, please complete the following steps in GitHub. In your own GitHub account, create a new private repository called ‘EDCI338’ (some of you have already done this). Add me as a collaborator to your repository (some of you have also done this). Create an issue in your repository called ‘Tracking’ or something similar with the following copied and pasted into the Description area: - [ ] Wow and Wonder 1 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 2 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 3 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 4 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 5 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 6 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 7 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 8 - [ ] Wow and Wonder 9 - [ ] Showcase 1 - [ ] Showcase 2 - [ ] Major Project - [ ] Celebration of Learning Assign me to the issue. This will create a checklist on the issue that you and I can use to track your progress through the course. Since it is a private repo, it will also be the place where you and I have assessment conversations. Major Project Thank you also to those of you who have signed up for a social media platform to explore for the major project. Just waiting on Learning Pod 6 to sign up. Next steps will be published on the Major Project page tomorrow. Trust and your PLN A friend mentioned to me the other day that she didn’t know what was true on the internet anymore. It is hard, especially in the context of complex and highly emotionally charged issues (I’m sure you can think of something in Canada…), to sift through the massive amounts of information that you encounter, even if all that information were to be from trustworthy and reliable sources. Unfortunately, a huge amount of the information we encounter is from distinctly unreliable and untrustworthy sources. The power of social media to connect similar people to each other is both a strength when you are building a PLN, and a hazard when used to drive polarization. Renee DiResta on Twitter has published a good article on how misinformation campaigns are remarkably mundane in how they start and are shared. It really doesn’t require a sophisticated operation when everyday people will do it all alone. As you read DiResta’s article in The Atlantic, consider the questions from the syllabus: Building a reputation and trust in a connected culture can be difficult, how are you building a network of individuals who are dynamic, reliable, &amp; participatory. Are you leveraging healthy relationships from your PLN for growth? What strategies do you use to ensure that you aren’t an unwitting agent of what DiResta calls ‘ampliganda?’ GitHub is a social platform focused around collaborating on coding or writing projects. In what ways have you connected with others in the class? Things To Do This Week ✔️ Compose and publish your first Showcase post, if you haven’t already. ✔️ Set up a GitHub repository of your own and invite me as a collaborator. ✔️ Create a tracking issue in your own repository and add me as an assignee. ✔️ Read It’s Not Misinformation. It’s Amplified Propaganda. ✔️ Publish Wow and Wonder #6 5 on your blog. ✔️ Continue planning for your Major Project. Week Seven (Feb 21-27) We are sliding into the back half of the course, and this week is a chance for you to recharge, catch up, get ahead, and just breathe a bit. This week, I am working my way through providing some comments on your first Showcase posts, so please make sure those are up to date and that you have created a course tracking issue in your own repository. If you are hoping to do some work on your Major project, I’ve published some more instructions on the GitHub Setup page. I’ve described how you can work in a fork of the course repository and also how to upload and add images to your pages (useful for the persona screenshots). I’m not going to bother you further until Monday, and we will not be meeting on Friday this week, but if you’d like to book a time to meet with me, I’m happy to do so. Thursday, Feb 24, 2022 🇨🇦 💔 🇺🇦 Hello, I’m writing this with a heavy heart. The news out of Ukraine in the last weeks, and especially in the last 24 hours, is distressing, to say the least. As EDCI338 is a course specifically about social media and personal learning networks in education, it would be irresponsible to not mention that there will be a massive social media misinformation campaign coming out of Russia and their allies. Please take care of yourself and what you share. Please remember that there are supports available for you through the UVSS, and you are always welcome to book a time to meet with me to chat. 🇨🇦 💔 🇺🇦 Week Eight (Feb 28 - Mar 6) ✨ Note I’ve just noticed that the numbering in the syllabus is a bit different from this site. This is Week 8 of the course, and Class 7 in the syllabus. Sorry for the confusion. Prior to reading week, we read about the idea of ampliganda, a term coined by Renee DiResta that captures the fact that misinformation gets amplified in social media and that we sometimes unwittingly become the vector by which it spreads. Little did I know that we would, in the following week, observe a misinformation campaign in such obvious clarity. The Russian embassy in Ottawa posted this tweet to their official account yesterday: Russian Misinformation Campaign I posted a screenshot here so that I’m not linking to it, which would cause it to be shared more widely. As it is, you can see the tweet was Retweeted 641 times (thie image itself was RT’d 2600 times) as I’m writing this. It is extremely difficult to stop ampliganda because of how social media works by encouraging sharing and creating more and more connections. I encourage you to read and follow the advice in this post from Mike Caulfield that covers four ‘moves’ to help you sort through misinformation. You can also find tools in this Twitter Moment. Surveillance This week, in a bit of a departure from the syllabus, I’d like you to read, discuss, think, and write about how social media tools of various different types are used to surveil us for profit. In this case, we will take a bit more expansive view of what ‘social media’ is in that some of the platforms that come up may not be considered social media by many people, but they rely on the same logic of gathering huge amounts of data from people, aggregating it, and analyzing it to draw inferences based on what the programers determine to be normal. The first platform that falls into this category is TurnItIn (TII), which you may recognize as the tool many universities use to, presumably, detect plagiarism (Note: TII cannot detect plagiarism, and it never has). TII is very much a social platform as it relies on being able to compare the work that you submit to it’s platform to the work that others submit and the work that others have published on the web. In my other job, where I am the administrator for Moodle, I receive emails from instructors in other universities requesting access to student work that has been flagged as being similar (I always deny their request as that would be an invasion of student privacy and violation of their copyright.) So, the social aspect of TII is completely hidden from you, but it is the key driver of growth for TII. How does TII profit from your data? Good question. Jim Luke, an economics prof in the US, has some thoughts on that. Another similar platform is Proctorio, whose business model is to convince universities that they need to pay Proctorio huge sums of money to require students to install spyware on their computer in order to prevent catch students cheating in exams. This week, you’ll watch some short films on the topic of surveillance in education and society to help you think through the impacts of what Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism. Things To Do This Week ✔️ Make sure you have received my feedback on your first showcase post. Check in your GitHub repository and/or your email for a notification from GitHub. Please be in touch as soon as possible if you haven’t heard from me. ✔️ Read the posts and articles linked above and scan through the Twitter Moment for resources that you can use. Keep in mind that some resources will be paywalled, don’t worry about trying to access those, just keep scrolling. ✔️ Watch #tresdancing from the Screeing Surveillance series of short films from Queen’s University. ✔️ Watch at least one other of the short films from Screening Surveillance. ✔️ Meet and Discuss with your learning pod the topic of surveillance in social media, both the platforms I mention above and the platform that you have chosen for your Major Project. ✔️ Publish Wow and Wonder 6 on your blog based on this week’s activities. ✔️ Begin collaboratively composing and publishing information about your chosen social media platform for the Major Project. You should have one person in your learning pod who has forked the course repository, and the rest of the people in your learning pod who have forked the fork (fork-ception). You should have published your personas, and this week you can start gathering descriptive data about your platform. I’ll publish more specific details about what to publish today or tomorrow. Week Nine (Mar 7-13) And just like that, we have 4 weeks left in the course! Just a reminder that week nine here corresponds to class 8 on the syllabus HOWEVER we are going to skip class 8 for now and jump to class 9, PLN in Education. I’m looking at the syllabus and thinking that things have piled up here at the end of the course, so I’d like to propose that we make an adjustment by dropping the Showcase Post #2 and moving the weight of that assignment to the first showcase, the Major Project, and the Celebration of Learning post. I have created an issue in the course repository where we can discuss this proposal. Please add your voice there. For the remaining four weeks of the course, there will be less of an emphasis on new content and a greater emphasis on you building your components of the Major Project. With that in mind, we turn to one last major topic in the course, and that is thinking about your PLN in the context of education, either formally, such as in EDCI338 or another accredited course experience, or informally, as in when you need to learn how to drive a manual transmission car, or juggle, or cook. Alec Couros is a professor at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan and he is one of the pioneers of the type of open course that EDCI338 emulates in some ways. Couros wrote a book chapter called Developing Personal Learning Networks for Open and Social Learning in which he describes a graduate course he taught in 2008. EC&amp;I 831 had 20 registered participants, but over 200 participants who followed along simply to engage in the community and connect with each other. As you read Couros’ account, there are some things that you may be interested to notice. First are the similarities between the requirements for EDCI338 and EC&amp;I831 in terms of reflective practice combined with collaborative work and using technology. Also, please notice that many of the technological tools Couros writes about are no longer even in existence. Their main course site, wikispaces.com, went out of business several years ago, leaving users very much in a lurch to find alternate homes for their content. Elluminate used to be one of the premiere web conferencing tools, but was purchased by Blackboard, the LMS company, and is now deprecated in favour of Blackboard Collaborate Ultra. Ning.com used to be free, but is now a paid service, so no longer popular for educators. The list goes on. One significant idea that I want you to remember in this, and a reason that I am using GitHub, is that tech platforms come and go, and with them, go their proprietary formats. If a proprietary format can no longer be read, then it is useless. If the platform disappears, your content disappears. Contrary to that, with GitHub, since it reads plain text files, you can take your content with you and deploy it in another platform with only some relatively minor modifications. This idea of being able to take your content with you and deploy it in a different system is called inter-operability, and it is a major concern in the social media landscape today. Think about how challenging it is to download an image from Instagram, or a clip from TikTok without one of those third-party apps (it’s not just me, is it?). This is evidence that these platforms are not inter-operable; you can’t easily use content from one platform in a different platform. Also, as you read Couros’ chapter, consider whether or not you have experienced a PLN either within your Learning Pod, or within the course. Have you been able to build trusting relationships within the class? Why or why not? Things To Do This Week ✔️ Read chapter 6, Developing Personal Learning Networks for Open and Social Learning (PDF download, sorry) in Emerging Technologies in Distance Education. ✔️ Publish your seventh Wow and Wonder post and discuss your posts in your Learning Pods. ✔️ Follow several educators in your chosen social media platform (whatever that looks like in your platform). Then, to find more educators, see who they follow and follow them. Feel free to use your persona’s accounts as well as, or instead of, your own. ✔️ Begin drafting and composing your Celebration of Learning post so it isn’t a panic in the last week. ✔️ Continue Building your Major Project page. By the end of this week (Mar 13), you should have a substantial pull request to send your work from your Learning Pod’s repo to the main course repo. Please be in touch if you are confused about how to do this!! Do not wait! It is up to you to reach out for assistance. Week Ten (Mar 14-20) Quick shoutout to Learning Pod 4 who were the first to send a pull request with a bunch of content for their page! I left some comments in the commit, and they may be helpful to you as you format your own page, feel free to ask questions in the commit. In keeping with the ‘End of the Semester is Coming’ vibe of the last week or so, I don’t have a lot of new content for you, although I would like to briefly revisit the topic that was scheduled for last week on the syllabus, which is to think about what it means to be a public individual on social media. I’d like you to read this article from the Globe and Mail about broadcaster Jody Vance and her experience as a high profile woman in BC and Canada who has a visible presence on Twitter. There are a few groups who have not been in contact with me recently and it would be very good to hear from you as the end of the semester is coming quickly and there is much work to do. If you go to the Network page, you can get a view of what activity has happened on the main repository and all the associated forks. ✨ ProTip I STRONGLY encourage you to have a look at the work that has been added to the course book so far! The whole point of the structure of this course is to give you visibility into what other groups and individuals are doing and to learn from and with each other. Work posted so far should be considered work-in-progress. ✨ ProTip You are also encouraged to create issues in the course repository if you have things to share with the class, need help, have questions, or maybe just want to compliment someone on their contribution. You can also interact directly with other groups by filtering the list of issues by label, then commenting on a particular group’s issue. Things To Do This Week ✔️ Read the Globe and Mail article about Jody Vance. ✔️ Publish your Wow and wonder post for this week. No…let’s be done with those. Focus on your project and Celebration posts. ✔️ Continue working on your Major Project DUE MARCH 27 ✔️ Continue working on your Celebration of Learning post. Your Celebration post will likely end up being in the range of 1200-1500 words (150-200 words per course outcome). DUE APRIL 7 ✔️ One last thing…please add your name, linked to your blog to the index.Rmd file in your fork of the repository. You will see that Tessa’s name is already there and you should copy that syntax to ensure your link shows up properly. Then when you create a pull request I will add it to the main course site. Week Eleven (Mar 21-27) Getting right into it…there are two key due dates coming up. Sunday, March 27 Your Major Project is due. I’ve added the last bit of what you need to do for that to the Major Project page. Please have a look there. ✨ ProTip Your Major Project is due on the 27th, but I will be scheduling assessment meetings to review your contributions between March 28th and April 2. You are welcome to submit updates between March 28 and our meeting. Thursday, April 7 Your Celebration of Learning post is due. Things To Do This Week ✔️ Complete your Major Project and create a pull request to send your work to the main repository. ✔️ Schedule a meeting between me and your Learning Pod to discuss your Major Project for sometime between March 28 and April 3. The link to book a meeting with me is in Brightspace. ✔️ Continue drafting your Celebration of Learning post, but focus on your Major Project if you need to budget your time. As always, feel free to book a meeting with me if you have questions!

Ultimately, you need to demonstrate to me that you have met the outcomes listed on the syllabus. In a course about social media and personal learning networks, that means you will have to demonstrate to me in your activities and in your reflections on those activities that you have, in one way or another, met the intended outcomes. Doing your work with that in mind will absolutely help you perform in the course. It also means that you will have to make your personal learning network interactions visible to me and to your fellow learners in the course. The way to do that is to tag your work in whatever platform you are interacting with edci338. The work you do will happen in two primary locations and some other secondary locations. Please see the Course Toolset for more details. The fundamental and core task in this course is for you to build and reflect on a Personal Learning Network (PLN) using modern networked tools. Your PLN will likely end up with two nodes by the time the course is complete. One node will be the network we build within this community of learners, while the other node (or maybe more) will be the professional connections you make outside the course. Hopefully, both nodes will persist beyond the end of the course, which is why it is critical that the work you do is NOT locked up in an institutional Learning Management System (LMS; Brightspace is the UVic LMS). Building Community Support This is an asynchronous online course, meaning that we don’t have any specific required meeting times. This can be a significant advantage for those who unable to meet at a particular time on in a particular place, but it can also contribute to challenges completing the coursework for those who prefer to work in more social contexts. We seek to strike a balance between learners working in isolation, and requiring on-campus meetings. To do this, there are three critical structures in the course: learning pods, weekly meetings, and assessment meetings with me. Learning Pods You will be provided a link to a password-protected page where you can sign up for a learning pod, which is a group of 3-4 learners who meet together regularly (ideally weekly) at a time that works for them. This time should be used to review the course materials and any questions that learners might have, and also to plan and organize work on the course assignments. Learning pods are intended to be your first line of support during the course. Weekly Meetings We will determine a time during the week that works for as many people as possible for a 1-hour meeting time with me. This meeting will not be required, but it is strongly recommended that you attend as many of these meetings as you are able. This will be a time to discuss the week’s readings, clarify questions about both the content and the logistics (what is due when and where) of the course. Assessment Meetings Each learning pod will be required to meet with me at least twice during the course. The first time will be within the first two weeks to ensure that you have been able to get set up with all the required tools and connected with a learning pod. The second required time will be prior to reading week to ensure that you are on track for the Major Project. Learning pods are also encouraged to book meeting times with me as needed. Community Contributions and Connections (30%) Throughout the course, you will be required to reflect on the work you are doing in relation to the topics of that particular week. This reflection will be in the form of blog posts on your own blog (either on opened.ca, or another blogging platform) and they will be due throughout the course. There are 8 prompts for you in the course and you will be required to respond to each of those. You will choose 2 to be assessed for grading as showcase posts (15% each for a total of 30%). Your 2 showcase posts will be polished for publication on your blog and should reflect a professional voice. Post Prompts (Reviewed in your Learning Pods) Your posts in response to each of the prompts will be in the form of one ‘Wow’ and one ‘Wonder.’ A Wow is anything from the week that caught your interest from the readings, videos, tasks, your PLN, or one of your fellow learners’ posts. It should be something that you haven’t thought of before or maybe that you have changed your thinking about. A Wonder is something that you have a question about from the same sources. It might be something you thought wasn’t explained clearly, something that is counter-intuitive, doesn’t make sense, is muddy, or simply something you want to investigate further. Your Wow and Wonder posts can be brief (100-150 words) and in point form, but they must include a hyperlink to the artifact you are writing about and a brief reflection on why you chose that Wow or Wonder. Showcase Posts (2 @ 15% each) You will choose 2 of your Wow and Wonder posts and expand and polish them to be about 500 words. You should reference course artifacts and find resources not listed in the syllabus to inform and support your thinking about your Wows and Wonders. Set a goal for yourself of linking to at least 2 other learners in each showcase post. You are encouraged to diversify your interaction and reading of other learners in the community. You should find that these interactions lead to increased traffic on your own blog, which will provide opportunities to have your thinking supported, questions answered, and possibly new connections made. It is recommended that you comment on others’ posts by including a link in your own post to the post you are commenting on. This will create a ‘trackback’ on the original post, which is just like a comment. Make sure you check the comments on your own site because you will have to approve them before they are visible. You will see a notification in the side menu of WordPress when you have comments that need to be approved. Each Showcase post should: be about 500 words in length, include a featured image, include hyperlinks to relevant course materials and activities, include commentary on and hyperlinks to other EDCI338 learners’ posts, a list of references including hyperlinks to cited work (use the style you are accustomed to) Suggested Prompts for Comments Please remember that these blogs are shared publicly, as are your comments. It is important to use your comments as a way to provide supportive, constructive feedback, to initiate a conversation, or to share connections. Keep your language positive, offer suggestions, and focus on the content of the blog post - discourse is encouraged. Examples of positive engagement include: My new thinking after reading your post is… I agree with the idea of… because… I am wondering if you have read this article/website/book (share a resource link) I noticed that our thinking differs in this way… A connection I made between your work and…is… I really liked how you explained…and I am wondering if you can tell me more about… Something I am wondering after reading your post is… Major Project (40%) You will be working on the major project throughout the course and in collaboration with both a learning pod and also with the whole class. The end result of this work will be a polished e-book of resources for educators who want to learn about social media and building a PLN. For this project, you will be working in Learning Pods, a group of 3-4 learners working together to help each other succeed. Each Learning Pod will be responsible for researching and publishing resources about one social media tool that educators might use in their teaching. There is a preliminary list of tools on the toolset page. The platform we will use to create the resource will be GitHub, a tool specifically designed to enable remote teams to collaborate on complex projects. Git, the software that enables GitHub, was designed to aid the development of the Linux operating system. We will spend some time early in the course becoming familiar with GitHub and the terminology it uses. While this may sound intimidating, it is well within your capabilities to learn to use it. One thing you need to know about GitHub is that it makes everyone’s contributions visible to the whole community. We will all be working in the same space, and everyone in the class will be able to see what everyone else has contributed. Project Details You will work in your learning pods to complete the major project, which will be to create an online resource for educators wishing to learn about using social media tools to build a Personal Learning Network. Each Learning Pod will contribute an in-depth analysis of one networking tool that might be used in educational settings. The structure of each page in the resource will follow the topics and structure of the course, so you will be working on completing the major project as you progress through the course. Celebration of Learning (30%) Your final task in the course will be to tell me what you have learned. This will be one final post published on your blog in which you reflect on each of the course outcomes and how your work in the course contributed to meeting those outcomes. Your reflection must include references and hyperlinks to: - your own work in the course and an explanation of how your thinking was formed, - your colleagues’ work in the course and an explanation of how their work informed your thinking, - course materials, including articles, videos, interviews, social media artifacts, etc. ✨ ProTip I STRONGLY recommend that you create this post as a draft at the beginning of the course and add to it throughout the course as we progress. It will be much more difficult to complete this post if you leave it until the end. An easy way to help yourself manage this is to create a set of outcome categories on your blog (outcome1, outcome2, etc) and apply those categories to the posts that meet those outcomes. Grading Standards Click here to read about the SOLO Taxonomy. "],["course-toolset.html", "Course Toolset Primary Tools Secondary Tools", " Course Toolset We will use a variety of tools in this course, as you might expect in a course about personal learning networks and using social media in education. One of the primary reasons for that is to allow opportunity for you to make your learning visible and to share it with the community, whatever that might look like for you. I recognize that you may be coming to this course for a variety of reasons, including as an elective for your Teacher Education program, but also as an elective in another program, for your own personal learning, or maybe because you heard about the series of courses that edtechuvic offers. Regardless of your reason for being here, you are welcome! It is important to note that we will be using multiple tools in this course, and I am aware that this can create challenges for people. While it is up to you to ensure that you have proper access to the information that you need, please ensure that you reach out to me if you have questions. These tools are central to the course content and it is literally my job to help you with this! Primary Tools These primary tools form the backbone of EDCI338 and are the core creation tools we will use. WordPress Instructions related to WordPress will appear inside blocks of this colour. WordPress will be our hub for EDCI338. The course hub is where I will post updates throughout the course and you are strongly encouraged to subscribe to receive notifications of updates using an email address that you often check. Additionally, you will sign up for and create your own WordPress site. It is on this site that you will publish your reflections on your work through the course. We have provided instructions for how to get set up on opened.ca. You may already have an ___.opened.ca website that you created for another EDCI course and you may use that one by simply adding an edci338 category to your posts. You may also use your own site through WordPress.com or another blogging tool, as long as the site publishes an RSS feed. The main caveat is that my ability to help troubleshoot your site may be more limited if you aren’t on opened.ca. GitHub A significant part of the work you will do for EDCI338 will be in the context of creating content using a collaborative tool. GitHub is a tool designed for the collaborative creation of software, but it can also be used for people looking to collaborate on text and multi-media documents. While GitHub may be unfamiliar to some of you, the workflow is not difficult to learn. - sign up with your uvic.ca email address to get a free upgrade. Secondary Tools The secondary tools are more topical in the course and will be the subjects of our explorations. Instructions related to secondary tools will appear inside blocks of this colour. An RSS Reader {-} There are numerous feed readers available on the web, but two that I recommend are Feedly and, my personal choice, Inoreader. Both offer free plans with ‘pro’ upgrades, but the free plans should be more than adequate for this course. Feed readers allow users to aggregate updates, or feeds, from various sources, such as blogs or news websites. Unfortunately, the free tier of most feed readers doesn’t include the ability to subscribe to social media feeds, such as Twitter or TikTok.

"],["github-setup.html", "GitHub Setup Markdown Fork, Pull, Fetch Adding an Image", " GitHub Setup Github will be the main location of our collaborative work in EDCI338. While Github was created for teams to collaborate on coding projects, it can also be used for many other projects. Some of the language around interacting with Github might be new to you, but that is ok, it will seem foreign at first, but the whole point of you taking this course is to learn new skills, right?! I’m here to help. The first thing you might notice is that there are some weird punctuation marks in the raw text in Github. That is called Markdown, which is a way to tell web-browsers how to style text. The basics are super easy to learn, and they map pretty well to what you might do in a word processor. For example, in MS Word, if you want to indicate a heading, you put your cursor in the text, and choose the Heading 2 style. You can do the same thing in Markdown by simply adding two hashtags and a space before the text, like this… ## Markdown Which shows up on the page like this… Markdown Each heading level uses the corresponding number of hashtags. Heading levels # Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 #### Heading 4 ##### Heading 5 ###### Heading 6 Styling text You can also style text as italics *italics*, or bold **bold**, and you can also stack codes so bold italics ***bold italics***. Lists You can quickly and easily create an unordered list (bullets) with either a *, or a - followed by a space… - berries - fruit - vegetables berries fruit vegetables You can create an ordered list by doing the same with a number and a .… 1.

In this case, the image is in the assets/w1/ folder. Things To Do in GitHub ✔️ Register for an account. ✔️ Create a new repository called EDCI338 ✔️ choose ‘Private’ in the visibility settings (step 4, above) ✔️ Go to the course repository ✔️ Click Issues, then New Issue, then Get Started to create a Learner Profile for yourself. ✔️ If you know who will be in your learning pod, please add the Label to your issue that corresponds with your Learning Pod, otherwise, you can just add a label that has fewer than 4 members already. Fork, Pull, Fetch Sometimes the lingo of Git and GitHub can be a bit confusing, and perhaps like there are too many steps to just save some work. Admittedly, the language does take some time to learn, but it is rather intuitive once it is explained. The way that we are using GitHub (editing content directly within the web interface) isn’t the typical workflow, but that is ok. You should think of the course repository, which I own, as the remote, meaning that it is the content stored on the web, not on your computer (which would be local). When you edit on GitHub, you have limited permission to make changes in that you can’t make changes directly to my repository, but rather, you need to propose changes, and ask me for permission to change the repository. You do this by creating a pull request, which is just you telling me that you have some proposed changes and asking me to pull them from your proposal into the repository. Creating a pull request like this is what allows us to collaborate on the repository without your changes overwriting the course materials. This creates a fair amount of friction in that you need to wait for me to approve your changes before you can proceed. There is a way around this though, and that is by creating a fork of the repository (several of you did this at the beginning of the course already). A fork is an exact copy of a repository at a particular point in time. So if you forked the course repo on January 14, you would have a copy of the course materials as they were on Jan 14, but there would be a notification that your copy is x number of commits behind the remote repo. If that is the case, you can catch up to the remote by clicking fetch upstream, then fetch and merge. Fetch and Merge in Github Once you have a fork of the repository, you can make all the changes you want to your copy of the repository, then, when you are ready, you can open a pull request to have your changes merged into the main repo. ✨ ProTip For EDCI338, you need to have ONE person from your learning pod with an up-to-date fork of the course repository, then the other people in the learning pod should fork that repository. for example, the main repo is at cmadland/edci-202201, and Chloe has a fork at chloelyh/edci338-202201, so each of Chloe’s learning pod members should fork chloelyh/edci338-202201. With this setup, each learning pod can be working on their own repo without any need for me to approve changes before they continue. then, when they are ready, each learning pod member opens a pull request with Chloe, who merges all the changes into her repo, then opens a pull request with my repo to merge all of those changes to the main. This way, each individual learning pod members’ contributions are recorded along with the learning pod as a whole. Adding an Image Adding images requires a little bit of work, as it isn’t drag and drop like you might be used to in your word processor. That said, it’s relatively straightforward. Add a folder In your repository, click the assets folder, then click Add file, then Create new file. Add a new file in GitHub This step will only create a new folder for you; you won’t add the image yet. Enter the name of your social media platform and then type a / (this step is important!!) and then type a random word like sample or placeholder. Give the folder a title Give the file a name. Commit and push your changes. Since this is your own repo, you will be able to commit directly to the main branch of your repository. Commit your changes You will then have a folder with the title of your social media platform inside the assets folder. There will be one file inside your platform folder, but you can ignore or delete it. Prepare your image file. Your image should be relatively small (under 1MB), so if it is too large, you can compress it with tinypng.com. The filename should be as simple as possible; one word is ideal. Don’t use any capital letters, punctuation, spaces, or symbols other than - or _. Upload your image. Click into your new folder, and click Add file, then Upload files. You can either drag and drop your image, or navigate to the file on your computer. Commit your changes. Here is an instructional video highlighting this process See the instructions above for adding an image to a page. "],["tiktok.html", "Chapter 1 TikTok Persona Demographics Privacy and Surveillance Social Media and TikTok in Education Balancing TikTok and Public Discourse", " Chapter 1 TikTok Persona Demographics Target Audience and Users Tik Tok is available in over 150 countries, storing the information of over 1 billion users. The widespread population of users has approximately 120 million users residing in the United States, 87 million from Indonesia and 72 million in Brazil. Surprisingly, Canada does not currently make the shortlist of countries (top 10), that hold the greatest number of users. Owed to the increase of technological advancement, it is evident why the main demographic of consumers is what is commonly referred to as the “Gen Z.” A totalled 60% of users match Gen Z’s age group (individuals born between the years of 1997-2012) with a majority aged between 10-25. With that being said, it should be noted that TikTok requires its users to meet the minimum age requirement of 13 years old. An older demographic of seniors can be seen on this app too, though they constitute an unusual subset. Similar success has been recorded of older generations, with great traction and activity on their platforms. To name a few, (oldgays?) is a group of older men that share their thoughts and opinions on life, and (cookingwithLynja?) shares insight on how to make yummy meals in a quick and easy fashion. In comparing the gender of TikTok’s users, there is an obvious breakdown of genders and their active use on the app. To date, identified females make up the majority of users with a remainder of male users (39%) and others (2%) constituting the rest. TikTok targets individuals with interests and hobbies of all sorts. Promising a guarantee for users to be matched with creators that align with their hobbies and interests, running from fashion to baking, dance and/ or travel. Tiktok has enabled users to create business accounts to allow for easy, accessible and reviewal of the accounts analytics. Businesses in particular have greatly utilized the analytics page to pinpoint the age, gender, and likes of their active users. The information received from the analytics, successfully supplies and equips companies with the proper tools to adapt and progress. Non-users TikTok does not require users to create an account to browse the platform. There are a variety of methods that allow non-users to navigte the platform. With a few simple steps, users that do not wish make an account are able to view the content. The first option consists of following three simple steps: 1. Go to TikTok.com 2. Select “For you” on the left sidebar 3. Begin watching videos without logging into an account Videos made and created on TikTok’s platform can also be viewed on other neighbouring media platforms. Multiple channels on youtube have dedicated their content to uploading what is currently trending on Tik Tok. Content creators of youtube make it possible for users without an account to gain quick and easy access to like and comment on the video on youtube. TikTok videos may also be viewed without an account if they’re sent by message, Snapchat, email, Facebook etc. With that being said, there are a variety of features that can not be accessed by users without an account. Without an account, you are unable to follow creators, like videos, see or write comments on the videos, upload or share content or join creators ‘lives.’ How Users are Connected TikTok features allow users to generate communities online. Users can stay connected through the act of sharing, following, commenting or liking other creators’ posts. Simply by locating and following a creator’s account, their videos will be readily available for viewing in the “following” section of TikTok. Unless the creator’s content is made private, a user does not need to wait for access to be granted, in order to proceed in viewing the video of the account. Furthermore, there are obligations for users to follow one another back, however, access to the creator’s videos is still made available regardless of mutual following. There exists two types of pages to view content. The ‘for you page’ showcases viral Tik Toks and creators of all sorts. This side of TikTok may allow users to discover new creators they wish to connect with or follow. After the user has followed the creator, their content may now exist on the other side of TikTok. Separated into two sections, the videos published by the users following will appear on the ‘following’ page, while other creators will appear on the “for you page.” The users following page exists to serve individuals with accessible access to their favourite content creators and avoid missing out on their friend’s and families’ posts. Another way to interact on TikTok is to engage in creators’ “lives.” Users may choose to go live to interact with their followers in real-time. By sharing insight into their daily living, creators find great success in expanding their followers and creating user engagement. Another unique feature allows for creators to go live with other fellow creators on the app. TikTok lives provide users with access to comment, ask questions and send or receive gifts. Although, TikTok requires users to meet a following of 1,000 and be 16 years of age in order to host a live. Content Content Sharing On TikTok, users have the ability to share any post they see on their feed. In order to share a video, users must tap the arrow located in the bottom right hand corner. Once the user has clicked the share arrow, a variety of methods to share are displayed. These options include the ability to share the video through copying the link or sharing it on another social media platform such as Snapchat, Messages, Facebook messenger or Instagram. share Privately Sharing Content When a user initially creates a TikTok account, the videos and comments are set to be public. This means any TikTok user can access the content and follow the account. However, TikTok does have Privacy settings that allow the account to be changed to private. When the account is set to private, the account holder can approve or deny follow requests and only their approved followers can view the content. Even if the account is set to public, the account holder has access to edit the privacy settings on individual videos. These privacy settings allow users to allow everyone access, only the followers that users follow back, or only the account holder to view the video. content Viral Content Content published on TikTok has the ability to go viral any time a user creates and uploads a public video onto their account. If the content a user creates gets picked up by the TikTok algorithm, it will be shared to other users via the “For You” page. Based on the user’s interests and past interactions with TikTok videos, TikTok’s algorithm curates a “For You” page of video content from creators the user may not follow. The algorithm utilizes users’ data on interactions with videos such as the screen time of watching a video, liking the video, and/or sharing it. foryou Once the video makes it to the “For You” page, it has the opportunity to go viral. As a video receives more comments, likes, shares, and duets, the greater its chances are of being picked up by the algorithm. The completion rate of a users’ videos is an additional factor that influences ranking. In short, the more a video is liked and fully watched, the greater it’s chances are of going viral.1 Business Details Private Parent Company Major Investors Revenue Generated Privacy and Surveillance TikToks ToS and Privacy Policy Terms of Service Privacy Policy Privacy Policy for Younger Users Key Takeaway’s from TikToks Privacy Policy The Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy (PP) serve as a legally binding contract between TikTok and its users. Confined within this document is advanced terminology which the average person would find difficult to comprehend. A crucial point stated in the document notes that Tiktok is not held accountable for the privacy policy of third-party partnerships and advertisements that are provided in the app via Cookies (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 20). Following that, Tiktok is also not liable if the user is to click a link outside or from a Third-party source (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 37). Under the section ‘User Content and Behavioural Information’ TikTok explains that by giving informed consent, the app may collect users information present in their content including their background, face, location and bodily attributes. They also disclose information may be obtained regarding your interests, gender, and age as means to “personalize” content and “[promote] your content to other users and exploring whether your profile presents further opportunities for collaboration” (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 10). With reference to the Privacy Policy for Younger Users (YUPP), the document was substantially shorter that that of the General Privacy Policy (GPP). The Policy states that limited information is obtained from youth under the age of 13 residing in the United States (US). This includes the username, password, date of birth, device ID, IP address, web browser type and some app activity (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 1-2 ). This information is only acquired for troubleshooting and other analytical services. In addtion, this is also collected for legal and governmental reasons which not only is rare, but is reasonable as it is law enforcement. (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 4 &amp; 6). An apparent difference found between the YUPP and GPP resides in the difference of protection between users. Those who are 13 and under are subject to much less severe policies and are inclinded to more privacy. In contrast, those who are over the age of 14 are forced to forgo their privacy and grant TikTok access to a great deal of their personal information. Users should be encouraged to review the Policy Acts laid out by TikTok, in order to be fully made aware of and comfortable with their decision to sacrifice their privacy rights. TikTok recommends that any questions or concerns with respect to the ToS or PP be directly addressed to them via email (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 34). Social Media and TikTok in Education Interactions on TikTok Tiktok serves as a great resource for individuals to interact with other content creators, comedians or those in the arts community. The platform includes a plethora of features that allow its users to comment, like, share and send gifts to their favourite content creators. Leaving Comments A comment can easily be made on TikTok with a few simple steps! 1. Select the video you plan to interact with 2. From here, you must tap the comment icon located on the right 3. Tap the “add comment” box and write a message 4. Lastly, press send when you’re ready! Pictures ’Liking\" Liking a video has never been easier for TikTok users. In order to like a video, one can simply tap the heart shaped icon located in the middle right side of the page. Picture When a user likes the content produced by a content creator, the like is viewed by the person who made the video. However, it should be noted that unless you switch your privacy settings, everyone can view your video as well. Attached below are numerical steps to be followed if one wishes to switch their “like history” to not be viewed by others. Pictures Creators Educators on TikTik Educators use Tik Tik as a platform to reach audience members from all over the world. Tik Tok provides a platform for creators to share their voices and knowledge. Videos are created with the intent to educate viewers, answer questions and promote learning. All types of content are currently being taught on TikTok. Educators such as (Dad?), how do I? Provides valuable life lessons and educates viewers on how to fix things. You can also access content such as (Janelle?) Rohner which educates viewers on Keto lifestyles and provides weight loss tips. Depending on the type of content the creators produce, this determines the type of audience members. For instance, (Dad?), how do I? Has an audience of mostly young people while (Janelle?) Rohner’s audience is an older audience as some of the content she shares is keto drinks for those 19+. No matter the topic of interest, there is sure to be a content creator producing educational content on that particular topic. Educators Responses to Comments and Questions A majority of creators prioritize replying and addressing questions made by their audience to create engagement and prove continstency. Responses can directly be responded to in a video, and is often done so by creators. When a question has been asked, educators may produce a video that shows the question being asked and them addressing it. This way, they can directly address the comments and/or questions of their viewers. An example of this is shown below. Picture TikTok as a PLN Educators on Tik Tok are able to use the platform as a Personal Learning Network (PLN). For instance, Tik Tok provides educators with a space to share and utilize worksheets, assignments and activities that fellow teachers have created. The growth of TikTok has allowed it to beome a virtual team, to distribute and swap ideas. The app can be a great tool for teacher to expand their personal learning networks and gain insight on useful methods employed by teacher alike. Educational Post on TikTok Experience …Waiting to recieve more feedback on our post we made on TikTok before answering Concerns with TikTok As with any social media platform, educators should be aware of the inappropriate content that can be accessed on the app. The most obvious sources of adult content on TikTok are profanity and suggestive clothing. Although the minimum age for a TikTok user is 13 years old, the app does not use any age verification tools when users are creating an account. With the ability to search any hashtag or keywords in the app, users can access any content created by another user. Although TikTok has strict guidelines on nudity and graphic content, since any user can upload their opinions on any topic, offensive content may be shared on the app. Due to the nature of the social media app, when a video becomes viral millions of people can be impacted by ampliganda. According to DiRestas, ampliganda is the new word for misinformation in the digital age. On TikTok, any user can now shape perceptions and realities by having their ideology amplified through shares, likes, and comments of a mass audience. 2 ^ [DiResta, R. (2021, October 5).

An important note about Facebook’s advertising audience is that there is a good focus on almost all the age groups. Primarily, however, 32% of Facebook’s advertising audience are people aged 25-34. Demographics: Amazingly, nearly a third of world’s population uses Facebook at least once a month. Although other social media platforms like TikTok have had a rising popularity over last several years, Facebook is still managing to get engagement from many users around the world. In addition, in terms of gender statistics, 56% of Facebook users are male with 44% being female. Interestingly, nearly 82% of college graduates are on Facebook and are much more likely to use the platform compared to high school graduates. Lastly, as of January 2022, India has the greatest number of users on Facebook (329.65 million), followed by the U.S. (179.65 million). Political Leaning: Facebook certainly tracks political views of its users and assigns political labels. However, it’s important to note that 73% of people believe that their assigned political label is accurate whereas 27% believe that their political label is inaccurate and doesn’t correctly reflect their political views. In spite of all this, 35% of Facebook users are assigned as liberals, 35% are assigned as conservatives, and the rest (29%) are assigned as moderate. Interests: “To say that everyone is its target market is not an understatement.” People sign up and use Facebook for a variety of reasons and there are many ways for them to express their interests. Users’ feeds are customized based on the people they follow and things they like such as movies TV shows, artists, books, sports teams, athletes, celebrities, restaurants, apps, and games. Hobbies: Facebook allows its users to add their hobbies to their profiles so they can find others with similar interest. There are many hobbies that could be added, and they are always shown to public users. One of the main features on the platform is Facebook Groups. It connects people from all around the world based on hobbies or interests, which is proven to be an effective way to build engaging communities. ### Can non-users browse or search content? Yes, non-users can use search engines such as Google to search for Facebook profiles, pages, posts, and other content. All they have to do is include the keyword “Facebook” in their web search or more efficiently include “site:facebook.com” to search for content on Facebook only. ### How are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating) On Facebook, it’s possible to message anyone without having to send a friend request, but the normal way for people to connect is by sending a friend request. Users can follow pages of celebrities, artists, athletes, etc. without them having to follow back. ### Can content be shared privately? Yes, there are multiple methods of sharing content privately with someone else on Facebook. The simplest way is by messaging them directly via Messenger and attaching files. Another method for private sharing is by creating a post on one’s personal feed and customizing the audience for the post so that only specific friend(s) can view the post. Sharing content posted by other users can also be done privately by sending them in Messenger and sharing to the personal feed privately. ### How is content shared? The main method for sharing content is by directly creating a post, which can be customized to be shown to different audiences. Users can photos, videos, and gifs along with other additional content when creating a post. It’s also possible host Q&amp;As, stream live video, tag other people, which provide engagement and dynamic options for users to interact. Moreover, there is an option for people to create private photo or text stories that will be visible for 24 hours on Facebook and Messenger. If users want to share content that other people have created, they can simply go to the post and tap the share button. They can choose one of the following options: • Share Now (Friends) • Share to Feed • Share to Your Story (Friends) • Send in Messenger • Share on a friend’s profile ### How does content go viral? One of the many ways to go viral is to post something that is related to the news, trending topics, or other major events that are happening in the real world. There will be many users who are searching and viewing posts about trending topics so there is a higher chance for a post to go viral if it’s socially relevant. In addition, most viral content is short and original. Users have a very short attention span and are often quickly scrolling through their timeline, so if a post catches someone’s attention, it’s very likely that it’s short and doesn’t copy other content. ### Is the parent company public or private? Facebook first went public in 2012 as the shares became available for selling in public markets. Note that Mark Zuckerberg announced on Oct. 28th, 2021, that the name of the parent company (Facebook Inc.) is now Meta Platforms Inc. ### Who are the major investors? According to Investopedia, the major insider shareholders are Michael Schroepfer, David Fischer, and David Wehner. Also, the major institutional shareholders of the company are Mark Zuckerberg, Vanguard Group Inc., and BlackRock Inc. ### How does the company generate revenue? The company generate most of its revenue by showing digital advertisements. Facebook’s business model is explained simply by Mark Zuckerberg in the video below. 2.2.2 References 34 56 78 910 1112 2.3 Privacy and Surveillance 2.3.1 A link to your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy 2.3.2 Your key takeaways from your examination of your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy 2.4 Social Media and your PLN in Education 2.4.1 Describe how people are able to interact in your platform. Can people leave comments on content? Is there a quick and easy way to ‘Like’ or ‘favourite’ something? Who sees that ‘like?’ Do creators generally respond to comments on their content? People are able to interact in my platform either through giving likes or comment or share posts. Some facebook accounts are made public, and these noramlly are business accounts. All people can see “likes,” even if they didn’t follow the account. If people want to “favourite” something, there’s a bottom on the right hand side where you can save the post. However, research shows that facebook would prioritize posts that are not business content, meaning that facebook is used as a platform that proritize communication on a personal level. ### How do educators use the platform? What kinds of content are they teaching? Who is their audience? Do they respond to comments or questions? Are they using the platform as a PLN, or are they only creating content? For this project, our group followed 10 educators on facebook, and they are all public accounts. Such as (Gerry?) Brooks, (Teaching?) in the Fast Lane. They would post their content and than tag another educator,or another eductational organization. In a recent post by Gerry Brooks, he taged a instagram account, which is interesting because when we click on that account, we are directed to the Instagram app. A lot of educators don’t reply to the comments, however, they will ‘like’ some interesting comments. The interaction in the comment section is not very active. But we do see some exceptions for example， (The?) Tutu Teacher is replying to comments and she has over 6000 followers. But each of her post did not receive many comments, so she is able to respond to most of the comments. In general, I think some educators are using the platform as a PLN, but there’s a notice pattern we found: the more followers they have, the more the educators would use this platform to simply share contents, rather than creating a PLN. But, the popular educators would still tag other educators, or repost their content, and comment on them. This may still be considered as interacting with their PLN. ### Are there any concerns that educators should be aware of regarding your platform (privacy, age-inappropriate content, disinformation, misinformation, offensive or illegal content)? They should be aware of the private message scam because as mentioned in previous section, people can directly message others on facebook without following them. Some scam would try to get one’s private message by asking “Is this you?”If they reply then they may be giving more private information in order to confirm with that person “this isn’t me.” Also, for an account that is made public, it is best not to share personal information on that account. Some educators made their account private but they are still able to engage in their PLN. So if the account is not to spread the content to a boarder audience, one should protect one’s privacy. ### Make note of other things you notice that a curious educator might want to know about your platform. This platform allows educator to create a group for the class, if they envite students on facebook group, they could better communicate with their students. Further, facebook also allows online meeting, so if there’s an emergent meeting, facebook live is always an option. Facebook also allows teachers to create polls, this could be a very good tool for teachers if they want to adjust the syllubas and ask students if they agree to these changes. Or they can make polls about course evaluations in the middle of semester, in this way, teachers could know if their teaching is working or not working. Teachers could also tag other teachers who teach on the same topic, and maybe share some experience with each other. They could also invite students in the conversation, let them also making connections with a wider educational network. 2.4.2 References 1314 15 2.5 Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse 2.5.1 How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media? Notable, high-profile individuals use social media mainly to distribute business content, using the platform share content and contribute to larger conversation with other notable individuals. Unless some comments attract their attention, they are unlikely to respond to the comment section. The higher the social status they own, the less likely they are going to reply to comments. However, they do tag other notable individuals, that may be considered as their PLN. ### What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN? Benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN might include: exchange knowledge, gain more access to resources and build relationship with others. ### Building community with online tools provided by an employer can be limiting, what are some possible restrictions and benefits? Some possible restrictions and benefits of building community with online tools might be: privacy are more protected. Usually an online tool provided by a company is more safe, because the employers know that the communication involves many business contents that cannot be leaked, so they will choose online tools that could provide them privacy protection. On the other hand, these online tools cannot provide employees an opportunity to connect to wider online users, and this limits their PLN. ### Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on? We think we can build a PLN based on the criteria of whether the members in the PLN respect copy rights issue, for example, they know the difference between creative commons and non creative commons. ### How do those who are veteran story tellers minimize the risk of sharing misinformation? They would know how to evaluate their resources, for example, see if their resources come from a valid source, such as database, notable publications, journals. They would compare different sites’ information on the same topic, and deliver their content after they done enough research about it. 2.5.2 References 1617 2.6 Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy (including Trust and Disinformation) 2.6.1 How do you present yourself in social media? Do you have separate identities for personal and work or school use? Do you integrate your personal and professional identities? Do you use different platforms for different purposes? I (wenzhuo) present myself in social media as a visitor, I am not a resident as far as I consider. I often view sites, or do research rather than distribute content online. I mainly use Twitter for political news, and YouTube to watch professionals playing games. ### How does the platform you chose for the Major Project incorporate accessibility and inclusion principles. How are disabled people treated on the platform? Are there multiple ways people can consume or produce content to meet accessibility needs? How do you include those who might otherwise be excluded? The facebook platform we chose for the major project incorporate accessibility and inclusion principles because everyone have access to the platform without discrimination. However, many of the contents on facebook are not filtered and full of personal bias and misinformation. This means, we could have posts that are discrimnative towards minority groups. ### Media Literacy, Trust, and Disinformation Does your chosen platform have content moderation policies? Does it flag disinformation, or provide links to trusted resources? How do you ensure that you don’t spread disinformation as misinformation?

YouTube has created a “YouTube Kids,” so even young children have to ability to watch videos with their parents being comfortable because the videos on YouTube Kids are appropriate for young children. The gender demographics of YouTube is split very evenly, with a report demonstrating that 45.8% of YouTube’s total advertising audience is female, and 54.2% of YouTube’s total advertising audience is female.18 This information is collected from those who report themselves or have their gender shown on their YouTube account. Furthermore, YouTube has launched local versions of the platform in over 100 countries—this demonstrates that YouTube is used worldwide. People use YouTube for many different reasons, some of these reasons are tutorial videos, entertainment, education, mindfulness, to share personal videos, and so on! Searching Content On YouTube you do not need to have an account to search the content and browse videos. There are some extra features though if you do have a YouTube account. Some of these features include, uploading your own videos, liking videos, subscribing to certain accounts, commenting on videos, more ability to control your privacy, watching videos in incognito mode, and you can create and share playlists. How Users are Connected You can connect to millions of people on YouTube. The main way people connect is by subscribing to one another. This means that when they post a video it will show up in your “subscription” section. Furthermore, you can comment on and like peoples videos. Content Content can be uploaded on YouTube in a variety of ways. Videos can be uploaded publicly for everyone to see, but they also can be uploaded privately. Content creators on YouTube get to choose the audience who can see their videos. If a person wants a video to be uploaded but only available for themself to watch, they can upload it privately. There is also a feature on YouTube where you can upload a video but only the people you share the link with can watch the video. Any video can be shared through a link. If the video is public and you have access to the link you can share it on your other social media accounts which can help the video gain attraction. Videos go viral by getting a lot of views. If your YouTube account already has a lot of subscribers, it is more likely for your video to go viral, but it is very possible to go viral without having a lot of subscribers. If the video posted is interesting, trendy, and the right people see and share it, it will go viral. Major Investors Photo from: https://fourweekmba.com/who-owns-youtube/ Revenue There are a few ways that YouTube makes money. The first is through advertising. There are advertisements on YouTube’s home page and throughout most of the videos on the site. YouTube also has a monthly subscription service called “YouTube Premium,” which gives them revenue as well. YouTube also developed tools to help eligible creators earn money in a variety of other ways, such as Super Chat, channel memberships and merchandise. In most cases, creators and YouTube share revenue generated from these channels. Privacy and Surveillance Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and Privacy &amp; Policy YouTube’s Terms of Service: https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=CA&amp;template=terms YouTube’s Community Guidelines: https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_ca/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/ Google’s Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en Key Takeaways from YouTube’s ToS and Privacy Policy There is an age requirement to use YouTube; you must be at least 13 years old and if you are under 18 you need parental permission to use the platform. If you are wanting to use YouTube Kids, children under the age of 13 may use it but a parent has to enable the service for them. This shows that YouTube acknowledges that some of their content is not suitable for everyone Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service You are able to report content to YouTube if you think it is inappropriate There are quite a few permissions and restrictions you must follow to be able to use YouTube Social Media &amp; PLN in Education Platform Utilization &amp; Platform Interaction Educators, or creators, are able to use YouTube to strike up interesting discussions as well as share knowledge for the desired targeted niche. They may do so by uploading videos to their created profile, or ‘youtube channel,’ in which users will be able to access and view their videos at the time of convenience. The types of videos uploaded will depend on the target audience of the educator. For example, The Organic Chemistry Tutor uploads tutorial videos on organic chemistry, general chemistry, physics, algebra, trigonometry, precalculus, and calculus—his primary audience, in turn, consists of users related to these subjects, most of which are high school students. In other cases, there are educators such as Michelle Emerson’s “Pocketful of Primary” who help fellow teachers lead a healthy teaching lifestyle by sharing ideas on classroom management, lesson planning, and building student relationships. The possibilities are endless and ultimately, it is up to the educator to determine the content they would like to publish. YouTube can be utilized as a personal learning network. Besides creating content, YouTube can help foster connections, maintain connections with relevant groups, and also allow for new learning. Each educator will have a unique following, where he or she will be able to interact with their community through a variety of methods. The most common form of interaction are comments—should educators feel the need to respond to a user, they are free to leave a comment. The following are a few other methods of how people interact on YouTube: 1. Comments 2. Likes 3. Community Posts Platform Concerns (Privacy, Age-inappropriate Content, Disinformation, etc.) Educators should be careful of distracting, harmful, and inaccurate videos that are published worldwide across the platform. YouTube’s content is generally not well-vetted, meaning that there is no requirement for published information to be accurate or truthful. In other words, creators and users do not have restrictions on what’s being said or shown through comments or videos.19 As a result, viewers can easily fall prey to misinformation and disinformation. Violent or sexual content can also be a significant concern. Despite YouTube’s community guidelines, sensitive content still tends to get past regulations. Fortunately, the platform has resources which enforces reporting and filtering of content such as the following: YouTube Trusted Flagger program Restricted Mode Community-Driven Reporting Balancing your PLN &amp; Public Discourse High-Profile Individuals &amp; Social Media High-profile individuals and their use of social media highly varies with their intent, and more broadly, their ‘branding.’ In general, these people are highly looked up to. ‘Branding,’ in this case, refers to a person’s reputation composed of unique skills and personality that has the ability to influence a mass of individuals.20 High-profile people attract a significant amount of attention online, on television, and so on. These individuals tend to have a big following and are generally scrutinized by the public eye more than the average person. This includes celebrities, musicians, politicians, etc.—depending on the individual’s intent, their platform can be utilized however they see fit, including the good and the bad. For example, there are celebrities such as Ryan Reynolds who utilizes his youtube channel to share lighthearted, and fun-loving videos as a form of entertainment. Despite the majority of his videos being published for movie promotions, his way of sharing online information is harmless and full of cheeky humor for everyone to enjoy. In other cases, there are politicians such as Justin Trudeau who upload daily youtube videos primarily showcasing crucial remarks on Canada’s political landscape. Through his videos, any individual around the globe who has access to the internet can be filled in on current events and strike up discussion as needed. These are a couple of notable benefits when it comes to being in the public eye and having a PLN, however, it’s important to recognize that at the cost of consuming information, users and educators are also at risk of misinformation. Minimizing Misinformation The best way in spotting and avoiding false information on platforms such as YouTube is to build a sense of awareness and be skeptical of the content that’s being shared or received. According to an article by The Conversation, this means taking the following actions: Educate yourself - Individuals can be easily manipulated by specific tricks of misinformation. It’s best to conduct your own research and understand how these techniques are being used against you—as a result, you develop a critical eye and become less susceptible to manipulation. Recognise your vulnerabilities - Biases can easily sway us. Tread carefully when critical information heavily aligns with your values and what you think is right. It’s just as important to consider other perspectives. Consider the source - Be cautious of where the information is coming from. Academic articles that have been peer-reviewed are one of the most credible sources out there, whereas a news article that is not backed by a confirmed expert may not be the most trustworthy source of information. Take a pause - When coming across information for the first time, do not believe what you read instantly. Take time to reflect and ask: “Is this information reasonable? Why or why not?” Explore the content and dig deeper beyond those words. Be aware of your emotions - Stay rational! Don’t let your feelings lead you to impulsive behavior that would instigate consuming misinformation If you see something, say something - Be proactive in taking action against misinformation. Protect yourself and others by simply pointing out falsified statements rather than doing nothing. Ultimately, there is no clear solution in minimizing misinformation. However, what truly matters is the effort put into rationally criticizing what we consume online for the sake of ourselves and for others. Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy Visitor or Resident We present ourselves in different ways on social media. The manner in which we present ourselves depends on the type of platform that we are using, the purpose for which we are using a platform, and if we want to be a Visitor or a Resident on the platform. White and Cornu (2011) state that “Visitors are users, not members, of the Web and place little value in belonging online,” while Residents share more of themselves on the Web and leave more of a digital footprint behind when engaging with various online platforms. We find ourselves falling somewhere in the middle of the Visitor/Resident spectrum. By looking at our own data, we are able to see that we tend to act more as Visitors when engaging with platforms such as Google and YouTube as we often use these platforms to seek out information without sharing information about ourselves. For the most part, we also tend to find ourselves acting as Residents when engaging with social media platforms where we share more about ourselves online. These platforms include Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. Interestingly, these are also the platforms that we use for more personal reasons. In our case, there seems to be a correlation between personal/Resident. Below are our Visitor/Resident maps for reference: map1 map2 map3 map4 Personal, Work, or School Identities We have separate identities for personal and work/school use. Our personal identities demonstrate more of our personalities and we are often more casual with the way in which we interact with others. Our work/school identities revolve more around the learning content and we often behave in a more professional manner. For example, if our goal is to keep in touch with others who were previously/are currently in our lives on a personal level, we would most likely use our personal identities to connect with them through social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and/or Snapchat, as these platforms are primarily used for personal purposes. However, if our goal is to collaborate with peers/colleagues for the purpose of professional development or completing a project, then we would most likely use our work/school identity to interact with them through online platforms such as GitHub or BrightSpace, as these platforms are often used for more educational/professional purposes. Integration of Personal and Professional Identities More often than not, we tend to keep personal and professional identities separate. However, there are circumstances where the two identities can be integrated. For example, a blog where we post about subjects that interest us or that we feel passionate about could include both personal and professional identities. Our blogs for this course, EDCI 338, bring out both personal and professional attributes as we discuss topics such as the many ways in which we use technology, our opinions on various topics surrounding the use of technology, etc. Although our blog posts address the content required in this course (professional/educational), we have the option to include our own opinions (personal) as well. YouTube is another great example where we can integrate our personal and professional identities. We use YouTube for personal reasons such as watching videos in our free time that we find entertaining and/or creating content that we enjoy making for others to watch. We can also use YouTube for more professional reasons such as learning about various educational topics, uploading videos to demonstrate our learning in our courses, and/or using videos as sources of information. However, these identities can be intertwined by sharing the ongoing events in every aspect of our lives in our own YouTube channels. A channel can showcase anything that a user wishes to upload, including both personal and professional content. The Purpose of Different Platforms We use different platforms for different purposes online. We use some platforms for personal reasons while we use other platforms for more professional/educational reasons. For example, we use the University of Victoria’s online learning platform, BrightSpace, for strictly professional/educational purposes where we can access assignments and the learning content for our courses, learn from and with our peers through online forums, and be notified of course updates/upcoming events. On the flip side, we typically use social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook for more personal reasons that include staying connected with the people that we meet throughout our lives, posting our own personal content that we wish to share with others, interacting with other accounts that align with our interests, etc. However, since you can have multiple accounts on Instagram, it is possible to create both a personal and a professional account. Nowadays, this is becoming more popular as people can post about their personal life on one account while posting about their work life on another. We are aware of many teachers that have Instagram accounts where they dedicate their posts to lesson ideas, classroom management strategies, classroom organization tips, fun art project suggestions, etc. YouTube &amp; Accessibility and Inclusion Principles YouTube incorporates accessibility and inclusion principles by making closed captions easy to add to videos. Step by step instructions for how to add captions to your YouTube videos can be found here: https://www.ami.ca/youtube-accessibility. It is also helpful if content creators include the (CC) symbol in their video titles when they include closed captions in their videos to communicate this fact to their viewers.21 Jessica Kellgren-Fozard is an excellent example of a content creator with a disability who includes captions in her videos in order to reach and include more viewers.22 People with Disabilities &amp; Accessibility Needs YouTube provides content creators with an online space in which anyone can make and view content that pertains to them. While people with disabilities can use the platform, more can be done to increase online accessibility for them and to spread awareness. For example, mentioning the disabled community is a simple and effective way in which content creators can make their channels more accessible.23 Annika Victoria is another content creator on YouTube with a disability who gives her viewers insights into the living conditions of her daily life. There are multiple ways in which people can consume or produce content to meet accessibility needs on YouTube. Content creators can shoot their videos using integrated described video, also known as audio description, as well as “adding narrated video description to the post-production process”24 in order to make videos as inclusive as possible for blind and partially sighted individuals. Content creators can also include captions or sign language in their videos in order to reach and include deaf or hard of hearing YouTube users. Additionally, there are even options on YouTube that “allow international viewers to translate your captions into other languages.”25 Media Literacy, Trust and Misinformation YouTube manages its community and safety through several ways, mainly by both their staff monitoring what people post, but also through listening to other people’s comments and concerns about things that have been posted. For creators, they must adhere to the rules that YouTube puts in place. Some examples are copyrights and protecting creators from using other creators’ work. However, because of the significant number of creators on YouTube, they rely more on the individual to reach out and inform YouTube regarding a problem. If something violates a rule they have put in place, they do have an algorithm to try and protect the viewers; however, that only protects against misinformation about largely discussed topics such as harmful conspiracy theories, hate speech, and recently incorrect medical information about COVID. In terms of human staff, there are approximately 10,000 individuals who remove inappropriate videos. While YouTube does have a lot of techniques in place to combat misinformation, it is up to the people on the platform to alert them of the things that slip under the radar. Anything posted or commented on the platform can be reported to the company and consequently be taken down if found to be harmful. However, this does not protect against misinformation that doesn’t violate community guidelines. Below is a photo of the evolution of content moderation rules throuhgout the years. The main article linked to this photo can be found here. evolution YouTube does make the effort to not recommend or give attention to the videos that spread misinformation, however, there are always cases that blow out of proportion; thus, it is important to fact check things you see on YouTube. The platform ensures that their rules on content creation are very easy to find and that they extensively cover anything that could harmfully affect others. The creation of YouTube Kids is one example that helps younger children not be impacted by harmful content on the platform. Mature topics are banned for people under the age of 18 and a lot of misinformation on the platform tends to get corrected by other creators. That being said, blindly looking for correct information on YouTube is a dangerous act—a better solution is to research into multiple sources across multiple platforms and form an opinion from there. Users may also look into credible sources on YouTube who are backed with post-secondary and post-graduate degrees to which they can be informed by. To avoid spreading misinformation as a viewer, it is best to research what you are posting on the platform. Should the content be inappropriate, YouTube will take necessary action in removing the video. To avoid such cases, it is best to be respectful on the platform, ask questions before forming your own opinions, and ensure that you have fact-checked your information properly. The creator also has the ability to remove content if needed. Needle, F. (2021).

Though there are no official statistics on the average age of Discord users, one site estimates that majority of users are adults between 30-33 years of age.26 Though the creators of Discord made the platform with no targeted users in mind, the platform continues to be widely used by people who play video games as an efficient way to message and chat to others. Discord servers may also be created to connect users with similar interest or hobbies, chats with friends and family, and for educational or professional purposes [2]. Political leaning of users is varied, and there are many existing servers and communities for users of all positions of the political spectrum. Individuals do not necessarily need an account to use Discord. One can access servers or communities through a shared link, and are only asked to create a username and agree to Discord’s terms of service. However, if one does not create an account in that session their activity will not be saved [3]. Discord contains both public and private servers. Private servers are accessed only by an invitation from a member of the group, and are typically used to chat with friends or family members. On the other hand, public servers may be accessed by anyone and are typically larger communities for those with similar interests. Discord also has a friend request feature, where one can accept or reject friend requests. Content Content Sharing One of the best-known abilities of Discord is group-chatting, which allows content to be shared among individuals in multiple ways. * Server The primary way of how discord organizes group chats is through establishing servers, which are chat rooms where users can join to engage each other. Servers can be created for any purpose and can hold up to 500,000 members [5]. While some servers are public for anyone to join, most servers created are private and can only be joined through invitations. Within a created server, content can be shared under two types of channels: text and voice. Text channels enable the sharing of textual information as well as images, emojis, and files. Voice channels are like phone booths where members can engage in voice or video conversations. * Group direct messages (DMs) Another way of how content can be shared on discord is through direct messages. Similar to DM between individuals, group DMs can be used to communicate between multiple members. This content stays only between the members in the group, and both text and voice messages can be delivered within an established group. Private Sharing Direct Messages (DMs) On Discord, DMs can be sent between different users and allow users to engage in one-on-one conversations. These conversations will not be seen on a public chat server or any members that are not part of the conversation [4]. Private server channels Both text and voice channels within a server can be created as private. This means that only those with permission can access the content within the channel. This can be an effective way to establish conversations between group leaders or administrative personnel. Viral Content There are essentially two ways for content to go viral or gain more attention. * Discord Nitro Although discord is a software that is free to download and use, the software offers a subscription service with Discord Nitro. This paid service offers a range of extended features, such as better customizable emojis and upload size for file sharing, but more importantly, it allows a server to be boosted. A boosted server will have both performance and cosmetic improvements such as more emoji slots and better audio and screen sharing quality [6]. These features can help to create high quality and outstanding servers on discord and can largely improve the user experience within the server, which in turn helps to promote any content that is being distributed on the server and attract other members. * Expanding/advertising the server Another way of spreading the content or the server is through advertising the server itself. This is a very straightforward way of promoting the popularity or awareness of any content on a server. Spreading the server invitation on other social media platforms can be an effective way. Websites, such as top.gg and Discord.me, ranks servers based on different categories or popularity and allows the public to join the server directly. Another way that can help attract more users is diversifying the members within the server community. Attracting people from various backgrounds can promote a higher level of networking across different fields and the potential for the content to spread across wider areas. Company/Business Details Co-founders, Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy developed Discord in 2012 and finally launched it in 2015. Since then, Discord has remained a private company, as it is not listed on any stock exchanges. As a result of Discord being a private company, it is not clearly known what sized stake each investor has. However, from when the company first launched, overall ownership has been split between the two co-founders and several other venture capitalist firms [9]. Some of the major investors that helped to finance Discord include [10]: Dragoneer Investment Group - Led the most recent funding round of $500 million in Semptember 2021. Sony Interactive Entertainment - Lead investor during secondary market funding in 2021 Greenoaks - Lead investor for a $100 million Series H funding round in 2020 and one in 2018 with $150 million funding. Index Ventures - Led funding rounds in 2020 with $100 million and 2018 with $150 million in funding. Greylock - Lead investor for the earliest funding rounds in 2016 Spark Capital - Partnered with Greylock as lead investors in 2016, funding $20 million. Discord collected various rounds of funding over the years and has had many investors to help contribute to the success of the company. Discord over the last two years has been valued at $3.5 billion in the year 2020 and $7 billion in 2021 [12]. Today, Discord’s estimated value currently stands at approximately $15 billion as a result of the funding by Dragoneer Investment Group [11]. As Discord does not use ads like many other social platforms, there begs the question of how does Discord bring in revenue? Discord earns revenue in various ways. Firstly, their main source of revenue comes from the subscription packages that they offer. The premium subscription, Discord Nitro, costs a user $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year, whereas their lower price subscription, Nitro Classic, costs $4.99 a month and $49.99 a year [7]. According to Discords metrics, there are about 150 million active monthly users monthly [8]. Following this they also make money through a 10% cut of titles that game developers sell through verified servers [7]. Notably, Discord also generates a minor amount of profit from the stickers and merchandise they sell, such as branded tee-shirts, hoodies, socks, and more. While there has been no revenue report for 2021, their 2020 revenue was reported to be approximately $130 million [12]. Privacy and Surveillance Discord’s ToS and Privacy Policy Discord ToS: https://discord.com/terms Discord’s Privacy Policy: https://discord.com/privacy Terms of Service, Didn’t Read overview: https://tosdr.org/en/service/536 Key takeaways from examining Discord’s Privacy Policy Key points from ToS: * Discord can read your private messages * Discord can delete specific content with no prior notice and without reason * Tracks users even if they use the Do Not Track (DNT) header * No right to a class action * Can sell or transfer your personal data as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or other type of financial transaction * Uses your personal data for targeted 3rd party advertising * Discord has a license on user-generated content even once your account is closed * Provides info about how they are using your data Key takeaways: Discord is given a grade of E by ToSDR. Discord does track you and can read your messages. You have no right to a class action lawsuit against them, and in the case of a dispute, you are forced into binding arbitration. Discord can license user content to third parties. Benefits in Discord’s ToS include that it requires specific consent to share your information with third parties, you can request to access and have your personal data deleted, and they provide information regarding how they will use your data. Overall, by using Discord you relinquish your right to privacy regarding anything you say or do when using the service. Social Media and PLN in Education Interacting on Discord Users can interact with other users using different features within Discord. A user can start Voice Calls, Video Calls, and DM other users. Users can use the “@” symbol in combination with a username to refer to other users. One may “react” to messages through the use of a large list of classic and animated emojis and memes using the Add Reaction (as depicted in the following screenshot). The platform also supports file sharing such as pdfs, Words docs, images, videos and more. One may also choose from a variety of other options using the ellipsis located in the far right corner of the message options as shown below. For video chats, up to 25 individuals can join one session at a time. Within a video session, one can either have their camera on or off, share their screens, and message each other. Educational Accounts One of the ways discord can help educators is through acting as a platform to encourage collaboration and discussion among learners. For members who actively engage in discussions, a well organized educational server can act as a personal learning network to engage with other learners and communicate on common topics. Code::together (https://discord.me/code) Code Together is a public educational server on the subject of programming and software development. Members of the server can range from absolute beginners to certified developers. It aims to act as a platform for sharing programming related resources and discuss specific programming problems or challenges. It also has channels for advertising personal or enterprise programming or software development projects. Just like other servers, any messages or posts can be quickly and easily responded to via emojis.Through observation, content is more likely to be responded to by others under channels with specific topics such as a programming language. The English Hub (https://discord.me/enghub) Leveraging the benefits of creating voice channels, discord can serve as a great platform for language learning. The English hub is a server targeted for English learning and sharing related resources. Learners at different proficiency levels can engage in discussions on a range of topics and communicate with members from various backgrounds.

Safety Concerns for Educators To be able to access the Discord website and app, Discord requires its users to be 13 years old and up unless local legislation mandates an older age. To ensure that the age requirement is satisfied, upon creating an account, Discord will ask users to confirm their age. If a user is reported to be under the age requirement, they will be locked out until they can confirm their age with an official ID document. Discord contains adult content and is not suitable for young children. Some servers and channels must be labeled as age-restricted for only people over 18 years old to have access. When someone tries to enter the server, a warning will appear to confirm their age and let them know the server may contain graphic content. Servers that are not labeled- should be reported. Discord encourages its users who are under 18 to activate their age-restricted content filter, Keep me safe. This allows Discord to scan images and videos that have been sent through direct messaging and block out any adult material or inappropriate behaviour. This filter can be accessed through the Privacy &amp; Safety section in User Settings. Along with this, users are also able to block any users who they do not want to communicate with. 4.1 Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse 4.2 Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy References [1] [2] https://discord.com/why-discord-is-different [3] https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360059214312-Use-Invite-Link-Without-Discord-Account [4] https://www.alphr.com/discord-dm-someone/#:%7E:text=Discord%27s%20direct%20messages%20allow%20you,you%27re%20all%20currently%20engaged [5] https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-discord-and-how-do-you-use-it [6] https://www.wepc.com/tips/what-is-discord-server-boost/ [7] https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/how-discord-makes-money/ [8] https://discord.com/company [9] https://www.wepc.com/tips/who-owns-discord/ [10] https://pcstrike.com/who-owns-discord/ [11] https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/chat-app-discord-is-worth-15-billion-after-new-funding-1.1652842] [12] https://www.businessofapps.com/data/discord-statistics/ levvvel.com↩︎ "],["weibo.html", "Chapter 5 Weibo Persona Demographics 5.1 Content 5.2 Company and Business 5.3 Privacy and Surveillance 5.4 Social Media and your PLN in Education 5.5 Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse 5.6 Avoid Misinformation 5.7 References", " Chapter 5 Weibo Persona Demographics 5.0.1 Describe your chosen platform in significant detail, including, as available (Wikipedia may be a good source for some of this info): Sina Weibo is a Chinese social media site. As a microblogging app that launched on August 14, 2009, it has become one of the largest social media platforms in China. In March 2014, Sina Weibo was spun off as a separate entity simply called “Weibo.” In November 2018 Weibo suspended the registration of minors under 14 years old on Weibo. Besides, Weibo is mainly used as a platform to cultivate user relationships and then share, spread, and receive information. Weibo opened its popularity at the beginning by inviting a large number of celebrities to join. As the user base grew, it continued to invite media professionals, government agencies, NGOs, and corporations t✔ Content Sharing o sign up Weibo to post and disseminate information. 5.0.2 ✔️ Target Audience There are more than 462 million monthly active users in 2018. According to statistical data analysis, the age group distribution of Chinese Sina Weibo users in 2020 is between 14 and 75 years old. 30% of Sina Weibo users in China are under 20 years old, 48% are 30-39 years old, 18% are 40-49 years old, 3% are 50-59 years old and 1% are over 60 year old. Weibo does not restrict the age of users but will ask for identity verification to make sure it is not a minor.Weibo are more uniform in their political leanings, as posting sensitive political statements can easily be blocked and deleted. Moreover, many international companies have registered Weibo official accounts to post advertisements of their brands, which is also an excellent way to promote their brands. In other words, Sina Weibo not only becomes a crucial part of the younger generation’ daily life, but also becomes a useful marketing tool for the advertising market in China. For users with different interests, Weibo provides different categories of topic or community discussions. So we can see many types of people on Weibo, such as the government, self-media, celebrities, painters, and corporations. Even for non-users, they are able to browse and search content on Weibo; they mostly use Weibo to read the latest news, watch their favorite videos and stories. 5.0.3 ✔️ The Connection among Users In terms of the connection between Weibo users, they are able to follow their favorite users without the reciprocation from them. They can communicate by commenting on the posts by texts and images; they can also have private chats to connect their favorite users. Furthermore, abundant fun emojis, stickers, and GIFs increase the engagement, and promote the connection between Weibo users. 5.1 Content 5.1.1 ✔ Content Sharing Weibo content can be shared privately. Even the private sharing function and private retweeting function of Weibo are well done. For example, Weibo users can set up groups so that the content they post can only be seen by the people they specify. The content can be shared through a variety of ways. For example, Weibo users can upload their Weibo stories and texts to share their daily life, and their visitors and followers are able to show their Likes and Comments on the post. They can also repost their favorite contents with the reference of the original authors. Moreover, Weibo users are also able to join topic groups, such as painting groups and cat groups. In the groups, they post some relevant images and keywords to entertain and help each other. Besides, Weibo users are also allowed to hold and watch live-streaming sessions to acquire and share the latest news and events; they can even do online shopping on the live-streaming videos. Therefore, Weibo provides excellent ways to foster communication among Weibo users. 5.1.2 ✔️ Viral Content The functions on Weibo such as Like, Comment, and Repost allow the information to go viral. The more people comment and repost on a post, the faster the information is disseminated. Moreover, the news posted by the official accounts and government accounts are recommended on Weibo’s home page, which can accelerate the spread of the vital information. 5.2 Company and Business Weibo is a public company. Sina Weibo went public on April 17,2014, with Sina taking an 11% stake in Weibo in the IPO and Alibaba owning 32% after the IPO. 5.2.1 ✔️ Major Investors 6.12% of Shares Held by All insider 46.36% of Shares Held by institutions 49.38% of Float Held by Institutions Top Institutional Holders: Bank of America Corporation Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Morgan Stanley Top Mutual Fund Holders: Allspring Emerging Markets Equity Fund 5.2.2 ✔️ Revenue Generating The profit model of Weibo is mainly advertising commission, which is very similar to Facebook.

Besides, videos are also profitable when they reach a certain number of plays and likes. 5.2.3 ✔️ Other Pertinent Information China’s established Chinese firewall and Internet censorship. As a result, Western mainstream social media cannot enter China. This is also a means for China to promote economic development and political correctness. 5.3 Privacy and Surveillance 5.3.1 ✔️ a link to your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy Weibo’s ToS:https://weibo.com/signup/v5/protocol Weibo’s privacy policy:https://mobile.biz.weibo.com/static/html/privacy.html your key takeaways from your examination of your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy: How do we collect and use your personal Information.

Weibo has the right to terminate the service if users violate the usage rules. The conclusion, execution, interpretation and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Mainland of the People’s Republic of China. Based on the terms of service of Weibo, it is evident that users are not allowed to sell or rent their accounts, and if discovered, they will be deactivated. It is also apparent that the organization can entrust its services to a third party or its affiliates and does not need to inform the user for authorisation. From the terms of service, it is clear that the registered user is responsible for the content posted on their specific pages and how they use the services (Arsarkij &amp; Laohajaratsang, 2021). The content posted by the individual should comply with the set rules, laws, and regulations. The platform is not responsible for any information or content provided by an individual. The terms of service state that the platform may be changed from time to time at the discretion of the organization. The platform may also refuse to distribute or remove content on the platforms if they do not comply with the set regulations. There are also some services on the platform that are paid network services, and as such, a fee should be paid for the users to access. 5.4 Social Media and your PLN in Education 5.4.1 ✔️ The Interaction between Users People choose to interact with others through a variety of ways, which depend on their personal preferences. Some people tend to text with pictures and emojis, and others may choose to post videos to share their current moods and daily life. In terms of the time limit of the posted videos, they should be within 15 minutes. Meanwhile, the viewers are able to make comments on content to express their opinions, which is a nice way to foster communication among people. The viewers can also repost their favorite contents with the references of the original authors so that more people are going to engage in the hot topic. Moreover, the viewers can show their likes of their favorite contents by pressing the “Like” button. They usually show their likes when they notice some humorous topics. They can also search their interested topics on Weibo’s search area, which helps people quickly find their favorite contents. In addition, everyone on Weibo is able to see the likes and comments of contents when the creators are not showing their posts in a private setting. The creators generally respond to comments, and interesting and thoughtful comments easily attract them to reply. Besides, people can also chat privately on the dialogue page, which allows them to have a one-to-one communication. 5.4.2 ✔️ Typical Users: Educators Educators can register an account with Weibo and share their content on the platform. There are all types of bloggers on Weibo, such as culture, make up, cook food, photography, and so on. They have an audience of people who want to learn this type of knowledge. The bloggers all read the comments of the audience and answer their questions. This approach improves the quality of the video and communicates well with the audience. Most educators use Weibo to create 5.4.3 ✔️ Feedback from Weibo Posts We made separate posts about the same life tips on different Weibo accounts, which is ‘Do you know what your standard weight is?’ and ‘How to calculate your BMI.’ After the release, it can be seen that the age group of active users of Weibo is 16-35 years old. The ages of our characters are 18, 25, 32, 46 and 58. By comparing posts 18, 25 and 32 have more replies to posts, and 58 has few replies. People are very interested in the weight corresponding to height at different ages, and they are more interested in learning about physical health. Users between the ages of 14 and 30 are concerned about whether their body is in good shape, and most users over 30 are concerned about whether they are overweight. And most of the people who reply to the posts published in each age group are people of the corresponding age group. Over 77% of Weibo users are aged 14-40, and most people who use the software want to get news, entertainment and daily life information. 5.4.4 ✔️ Educators’ Concerns on Weibo The management of Weibo is very strict. For example, sensitive words are not allowed, posts will be deleted if disinformation is posted, and accounts will be blocked in serious cases. However, the privacy issue of Weibo may not be solved very well, because nowadays, not only the phone number but also the ID and name of the person are required to register Weibo. The purpose of this is for the healthy development of youth education and better targeting of those who post disinformation. Overall, there are pros and cons. Therefore, educators need to be aware of these issues at all times in order to develop a better platform. 5.4.5 ✔️ More Information for Educators -Weibo is a social media, networking platform where users can share information with each other. -Weibo is characterized by fast information distribution and wide dissemination; it shows the top 50 daily hot topics, which include the worldwide news and events. -Weibo is good for marketing and can be a shipping platform for business people to promote their products and audience. In other words, it allows people to do online shopping. -Weibo videos are prohibited to upload videos containing pornographic, illegal, infringing, and other bad content. -Weibo offers a teenager mode. After turning it on, parents are able to control the usage time and the recommended contents on Weibo. Meanwhile, more educational and academic information are revealed on Weibo’s homepage, rather than the entertainment topics. 5.5 Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse 5.5.1 How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media? In Weibo, the function of high-profile individuals using Weibo is to bring more attention to themselves. When some fans know that their favorite idols start to share their life and photos online, they will always pay attention and bring some topics for them. When they have new tv shows or albums, Weibo is a good platform for publicity, which can also be seen by some people who do not know them and attract more people’s attention. High-profile individuals and celebrities use their social media platforms differently than regular people. They utilize social media platforms, mostly like brands, where they market their products on such platforms. In this case, high-profile individuals or celebrities will utilize these platforms to market their content, movies, or music (Yoakam, 2019). The platforms are used in such a way that they draw attention to their work, and they also receive feedback regarding their work. There is also the chance for these individuals to express themselves. 5.5.2 What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN? The benefit is that you can see yourself through the public eye and you can see the public from a personal point of view. It is essential to be on a PLN and in the public eye because it helps in the development of relationships. Through a PLN, an individual can ask for information and get valuable feedback from peers (Arsarkij &amp; Laohajaratsang, 2021). It is also possible to share content you have developed and other information enhanced through feedback from peers. Through a PLN, an individual can also increase their flexibility because you are able to decide the regularity of connecting with the online community. 5.5.3 Limitations and Benefits of Weibo The community built using online social media has certain limitations, and all the software used in China is monitored by the government, so this leads to some limitations. China does not allow inappropriate remarks on social media, such as insulting the country, illegal, pornography, etc. are all illegal content. If people want to discuss some sexual knowledge with community members on Weibo, post with overly pornographic words and the post will be deleted by Weibo administrators. There is absolutely no problem discussing national politics and gender relations on Weibo. But if you want to search on Weibo for specific drug words like marijuana, white powder, or cocaine, you won’t find them, which are all illegal words (drugs are illegal in China). Searching for ‘drugs’ can find some videos and articles of police anti-drugs, as well as knowledge of drug popularization. There are many minors on Weibo, so that they can grow up healthy and stay away from pornography, gambling and drugs. And people tend to get more positive feedback when they search for keywords to learn more relevant news or knowledge. Weibo management is very strict, and abusive and abusive words are prohibited. This is also a benefit, making the whole community more positive and harmonious. One of the restrictions of using online tools provided by the employer is that the work environment can be considered repressive by the employees, and this can work towards the damage of employee morale and confidence (Yoakam, 2019). However, the implementation of these tools helps improve the productivity of individuals at the workplace because time is not spent on other platforms. 5.5.4 Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on? According to ToS, Weibo is protected by the laws of the People’s Republic of China. Anyone spreading rumors on Weibo will be punished by law and restricted by the platform. You can file a lawsuit when you are threatened or treated unfairly on the platform. In order to ensure the safety of each user and trust platform must strictly require each user’s rules of use. To build a reliable PLN, an individual needs to open a Weibo account that allows the individual to follow and engage educators they admire. The individual may also start blogging their ideas, which helps connect with a broader community of teachers (Arsarkij &amp; Laohajaratsang, 2021). For veteran storytellers to reduce the possibility of sharing misinformation, they should engage teachers of similar topics because they have already researched. The veteran storyteller should also explore current events that are considered hot-button. 5.6 Avoid Misinformation Authors usually include a description of the source of the story when they tell it. To avoid the risk of misinformation on Weibo, most people write something at the end of the story to avoid misunderstandings, such as the above story is adapted from a true story or the content of the story contains personal opinions for reference only. Most microbloggers usually talk to viewers in the comments section when they post articles or stories on microblogs, which is one way to avoid misinformation. Another way is to look up certain information from other software or websites before starting the story, and adding the reference at the end. 5.7 References https://tenbagroup.com/what-is-sina-weibo-know-your-chinese-social-media/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo https://www.statista.com/statistics/320940/china-sina-weibo-user-breakdown-by-age-group/ https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/03/26/weibo-how-is-chinas-second-largest-social-media-platform-being-used-for-social-research/ https://www.dragonsocial.net/blog/chinese-social-media-weibo-and-twitter-comparison/ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WB/holders/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANfp3GIqiNOywMzMyw3p5HWxVgZmFc7LHEpxY2Og7GCqmbZHbVwXmsz67B4fmpFADiCYo37T-jJCW6QZE65Lt5CQ5SDVYAbDzi4phXPuNxr3FJ5H6nPNM0-lt2HDAdYAeBiwwqfrxkFYhvVYgnmgFtDFNETUb_AQnpEalQbNOJep https://weibo.com/signup/v5/protocol https://mobile.biz.weibo.com/static/html/privacy.html Arsarkij, J., &amp; Laohajaratsang, T.

It is demonstrated that 75% of users are between the ages of 18 and 24 years old. ✔️ Can non-users browse or search content? A nonuser of Instagram can search up the account and browse through the content. Furthermore, a none user can also search up hashtags to find specific types of posts. ✔️ How are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating) For Instagram, if a user wants to connect with another, they can request to follow them. This request then has to be approved if the user has a private account. In the case the user does not have a private account, the requester will automatically begin following them once requested. When direct messaging someone, if they are not your friend the user must accept the message. If users have already become friends they will typically just receive a notification they have received a message, and then they can proceed to view it. ✔️ Can content be shared privately? Sharing messages directly provides users with the feature of sending private messages. Moreover, one also has the ability to select individuals from their friends to view a private story. This allows for a smaller group to view your story instead of your entire following. ✔️ How is content shared? On Instagram, content is shared by making a post, this will show up on one’s profile. One could also post a story that can be added to your profile by making highlights at the top of your page. Content is also shared by direct messaging someone a post. The paper plane icon on every post allows one to forward it privately to whomever they wish. Additionally, one can also share a post on their story this way. ✔️ How does content go viral? Content on Instagram can go viral if one account is public and the post is sent to many other individuals, what can help a post go viral is if it includes hashtags. This way anyone searching up a specific topic can find your post if it is related. Once a post is viewed many times it has the possibility of being shared by accounts with a bigger following which then increases the number of times the content is viewed in turn making it go viral. ✔️ Is the parent company public or private? The parent company for Instagram is Facebook and it is a public company. ✔️ Who are the major investors? Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger founded instagram in 2010. Hoowever, Steve Anderson was the first Major investor in this platfrom as he provided the first cheque of $250,000. ✔️ How does the company generate revenue? The company generates revenue by advertising. In 2019 Instagram gained $20 billion in revenue. It thrives off of the fact that it is geared around young adults and these young adults enjoy finding new products to try. Furthermore, Instagram can get a higher number of individuals clicking on ads. Businesses have taken over on Instagram. Brands use this social media platform to advertise to a bigger audience they do this by partnering with celeberties or well known individuals order to advartise to the largets followings of young adults. 8.3 Privacy and Surveillance ✔️ a link to your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy Terms of use: https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/before-january-19-2013/ Privacy policy : https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875/?maybe_redirect_pol=0 ✔️ your key takeaways from your examination of your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy Some things I was able to find out about Instagram regarding how they use your data and/or tracks your movements were.. ~Information is collected specifically on the user of the platform. for eeexamplee, ones messages, the information you share, and communication with others. ~Location of a photo, and the date a file was created. ~What you see through features Instagram provides,ie, camera, filteers etc. is all tracked and seen by those who run the platform. ~Much of this information is to collect data and provide you with ads related to the content you observe. 8.4 Trust and Misinformation Instagram works with third party fact checkers to identify, review and label false information. Additionally, instagram also has multiple community guidelines for user motivation to continue being an authentic and safe platform. Those guidelines include: - Users should only share content that they have right to share - Users may only post comments that are appropriate for a diverse audience - Users must follow Law and not spread misinformation in relation to sensitive topics such as: - Bullying - Alcohol - Tobacco products - Hate - Sexual services - Drugs - Users must respect all members of the instagram community 8.5 Public Discourse High profile individuals usually use instagram for different reasons, it could be to interact with more people, or for promoting a brand through their pictures and videos, or could also be to share important information/content. Some benefits of being in the public eye and having a PLN are: - Individuals can interact with more people in an easier way - Make relationships with high profile individuals - Gain more knowledge for products/companies/brands interested in Some benefits of building a community with online tools by an employer is that the tools created could be safer than social media tools. This is because on social media tools everything is open source and all the information is public. Whereas a tool made by an employer can be more private and could follow security guidelines for employee safety. We can ensure that a PLN is safe and reliable if users follow the guidelines set by the community. Veteran story tellers could connect with third party fact checkers to identify misinformation. Or they could also use different sources to find information and cross check if the information matches. 8.6 Education Instagram is a unique social media network, it is built almost entirely around sharing images and videos. You can get Instagram on smartphones, and Instagram has a desktop version as well. You can view your feed, like and comment on posts, and send and receive direct messages like other social media platforms. There is an easy way to ‘like’ someone’s post, by simply double tapping their content. Everyone can see the likes they got from their followers, unless you have the privacy setting turned as “private” or “visible to me only.” With the privacy setting, you can manage if you want your followers to see who liked your post or not. Generally, depending on the amount of followers an Instagram account has, the less the followers, the more likely you get responded by the creators if you comment on their posts. However, even for an Instagram official account that has more than 10 million followers, your comments can still get responded to, it’s rare, though. Educators use Instagram as a more straightforward way to teach compared to other platforms. Educators use graphics, images, videos to support text in a clear and simple way to the learners and people who are interested with the topic. The content educators teach can vary quite a lot, from academic education to practical education, due to the openness and freedom people have on Instagram. It means that people can learn materials on Instagram that would help them succeed in university, as well as in life. The audience could be anyone who has an Instagram account, and usually people tend to follow Instagram accounts that match their areas of interests. Educators on Instagram typically are open to respond to questions, especially when good questions are asked. Some educators use Instagram as a PLN, which they also learn, share materials with other people whereas some educators only use Instagram for creating content. For Instagram, it’s extremely important to gain as many followers as possible if you want your posts to get some views. In our learning pod, each of us created a new account for Instagram and we posted some short educational posts to see how people would react to it. However, this is not how Instagram works, none of us received a comment by someone. Therefore, Instagram is best used when you already have some reputation in your education career and suggest your learners to follow your Instagram account for more interesting content. So, people respond to the same post similarly if the creator of the post is reputed and authoritative. Educators should always be aware of negative things such as offensive and inappropriate content on any social media platform. There are countless cases of people getting insulted, humiliated while using Instagram. Educators should focus on things they can have control of, and avoid creating posts that consist of racist messages, for instance. Instagram has a powerful feature that can help protect people when they experience a rush of abusive comments and DMs. The feature is called Limits, that is easy to turn on, and will automatically hide comments and DM requests from people who don’t follow you, or who only recently followed you. As the Internet makes the educational process more interesting than ever, educators should keep themselves up to date with the cool features of social media platforms and get the most out of it. Instagram can become a great educational tool that makes the educational process unique, interesting, and insightful. For example, in teaching, instead of having a physical file of a portfolio, educators can encourage students to create a digital portfolio, or e-portfolio, on Instagram. A cool benefit for learners to use Instagram for learning is that Instagram helps build interpersonal skills. Interpersonal skills are a key element to ensure healthy personal and professional lives. With Instagram’s cool feature of sharing personal stories and interests with others, teachers can encourage students to engage with their peers in Instagram, and form groups on the platform. Instagram is a cool addition to class even for a traditional classroom. 8.7 Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse Notable, high-profile individuals have a chain of social media accounts, including Instagram, Twitter, etc. For educators who have established a PLN in social media platforms, it’s much easier for them to browse the content they need and make positive interactions with other people. On Instagram, if there’s a blue check mark in the profile page of an account, that means their posts are from a reputed, authoritative official account. Therefore, when building a PLN on Instagram, following those official accounts will give you more reliable information. 8.8 Reflection 8.8.1 Digital Identity Personally, I present my personal identity and school identity on Instagram as it is more casual in comparison to my work identity which is presented on LinkedIn. The reason for this is to keep my professional and work-related material and aspects of my life such as my accomplishments and my qualifications to remain aligned with future goals and opportunities. I do keep my personal and school accounts generally formal as well. However, I am more relaxed about posting everyday experiences or the more social and adventurous aspects of my life on my personal platforms. I do believe using a social platfroms is very beneficial for professional use. In the reading by Rajagopal, et al. 2012, for my first Wow and Wonder post I was facinated to understand how big of a role the three-layered approach proposed by Grabher and Ibert (2008) placed on networking in a professional setting. The importance of the communality layer/strong ties, sociality layer/weak ties, and connectivity layer/very weak ties when building these connections in a workplace can lead to a more mentor based relationships with leaders in those companies. These relationships can then aid in individuals avoiding making mistakes when making bigger career based decisions down the road. Thus, I belive it is important to keep personal and professional identities sperated. 8.8.2 Access and Inclusion Inclusive design aims to provide the user with a good experience. It is known as shifting away from the idea of “one-size-fits-all.” And moving towards creating a design for a diverse range of users. Accessibility on social media platforms is in relation to recognizing exclusion and displaying information in a clear manner. Instagram provides the following to increase inclusion and accessibility: - Automatic captioning - Alt-image descriptions - Include descriptive captions - Screen reading - Adjust text size - Manage video captions Following are the ways in which people can produce content to meet accessibility needs: - Writing in plain language - Adding hashtags and mentions - Limit emoji use - Avoid special characters - Descriptive image captions - Use good color contrast: Avoid color contrasts that are difficult to read Personally, I think that information should be easily accessible and understandable for everyone in our society. Visual, speech, physical, all sorts of measures should be taken into consideration when implementing accessibility tools. Social media is a really powerful tool which allows our communities to share information easily, therefore, it is critical for social media platforms to have necessary accessibility measures. 8.8.3 Media Literacy, Trust, and Disinformation A content moderation policy is created by operators that prohibit users from posting certain content, such as content that exhibit graphic violence, child sexual exploitation, and hateful content. In Instagram, content moderation policy is used to protect members of the Instagram community. Instagram will remove content that contains hate speech, repeated unwanted messages, etc. Instagram doesn’t flag disinformation itself, however, users are encouraged to report disinformation they saw and the content will be removed after the inspection by Instagram. Media literacy provides a framework to access, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms – from text to video. It’s important to note that media literacy is not just about “protecting” us from unwanted messages. Media literacy is more about helping us become competent, critical, and literate in all media forms so that we control the interpretation of what we see or hear rather than letting the interpretation control us. It’s important for us to be aware of the information on the social media platforms, some of them could be fake. For me personally, I use critical thinking (a strategy that is more often used in writing an assignment) for browsing information on Instagram as well. I perceive everything on Instagram as 50% real and 50% fake, and only to believe it’s 100% real if I can verify the information. So I never get troubled by misinformation on Instagram and other social media platforms. 8.9 Resources https://blog.hootsuite.com/inclusive-design-social-media/ https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/combatting-misinformation-on-instagram https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119 https://nealschaffer.com/instagram-target-audience/#:~:text=The%20Instagram%20demographic%20shows%20that,25%20and%2029%20years%20oldhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030915/how-instagram-makes-money.asp https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/before-january-19-2013/ https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875/?maybe_redirect_pol=0 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1223776.pdf https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-ways-to-protect-our-community-from-abuse https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/03/23/steve-anderson-baseline-ventures-instagram-venture-capital-raver/?sh=4e45a62a354d https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instagram https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3559/3131 "],["zenly.html", "Chapter 9 Zenly 9.1 Persona 9.2 Demographic 9.3 Privacy and Surveillance 9.4 Social Media and your PLN in Education 9.5 Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse 9.6 Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy (including Trust and Disinformation)", " Chapter 9 Zenly 9.1 Persona 9.2 Demographic ✔️ target audience (age, demographics, political leaning, interests, hobbies, etc) Friends and family members. Zenly is popular among teenagers. Zenly is an app that combines three functions: social, messaging, and mapping. Over 2 million people have downloaded the Zenly so far. ✔️ can non-users browse or search content? Non-users cannot browse or search content. You must first sign up. ✔️ how are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating) When using Zenly, if users want to connect with other users, they must request to add other users as friends, and this request requires the other user’s acceptance. Only after the two users become friends, then they can chat with each other, view each other’s location, etc. ✔️ can content be shared privately? Yes, Zenly provides private sharing and communication between friends and family. Zenly also provides privacy settings, you can only open it to some of your friends. ✔️ how is content shared? Zenly mainly provides basic location sharing, and friends can roughly know the specific places you have been to and slept through through the app. This also forms your own social map to share with your Zenly friends. zenly presents your life experiences by displaying your best friends and favorite places in the app. For example, your best friend will appear larger than others so you can connect with them. Zenly’s feature is that you can exchange emoticons with your friends, which is a cool way to communicate. ✔️ how does content go viral? Zenly’s dissemination method is to add friends to disseminate content by adding address book, user name and mobile phone number, touch and so on. zenly will send you push notifications in the following situations: when a friend accepts your request, when a friend receives a message, when a friend adds you to a gadget, when a friend’s location changes. For example: when they travel to another country, such as the United States. Of course, if you don’t want to receive push notifications, just turn them off in settings or check your Zenly notification preferences. ✔️ is the parent company public or private? The parent company Snap Inc. is an American camera and social media company, founded on September 16, 2011. by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown based in Santa Monica, California. ✔️ who are the major investors? According to the Crunchbase, the major investors are Benchmark, Peter Fenton, Jerry Murdock, Xavier Niel, and Olivier Thomas. Those investors have invested $22.5 million.27 ✔️ how does the company generate revenue? Zenly does not have subscription and in-app purchase. The company will develop its own data mapping system to provide users with its own brand services. 9.3 Privacy and Surveillance 9.4 Social Media and your PLN in Education ✔️ Describe how people are able to interact in your platform. Can people leave comments on content? Is there a quick and easy way to ‘Like’ or ‘favourite’ something? Who sees that ‘like?’ Do creators generally respond to comments on their content? People can share locations with their friends in real-time on Zenly, and friends can see each other’s exact location, how fast they are moving, and the battery status of my phone. To take into account the privacy requirements of some users, they can turn off the background operation of the app. When people choose to use Zenly, it means they are willing to share their location and detailed status with people they trust. Zenly is a very easy-to-use app. First of all, you and your friends are on a map, and you can say hello by sending emojis. The more friends you have, the more emotes you can unlock. People can chat, share photos, videos in Zenly, but these are only visible to friends. Friends can respond to your post with a ‘like‘ emoji. Friends can see ‘like‘. The creator generally responds selectively and will reply to some questions that he considers more important. ✔️ How do educators use the platform? What kinds of content are they teaching? Who is their audience? Do they respond to comments or questions? Are they using the platform as a PLN, or are they only creating content? To be honest, few educators use this software. Generally, educators will add a lot of friends at the beginning, such as friends of friends, and recommend friends. Educators can see the location and status of these friends, which is helpful for some offline organizations. Educators will share their work with their friends, and they can discuss it together. It is easy to find some like-minded friends and organize offline activities. They are using Zenly as a PLN because Zenly is a piece of software that requires a lot of interaction. When you become friends with each other, it shows that you trust each other, which is different from other platforms. ✔️ In your Learning Pod, plan and publish more than one *SHORT educational ‘post’ (whatever that looks like on your platform). Don’t put huge amounts of effort into your post. A simple ‘ProTip’ or ‘LifeHack’ type of post, or a ‘Did you know…[something you know about…].’ Publish your posts on a few of your Learning Pod’s accounts. How do people respond to your post? Do they respond to the same post differently depending on the persona of the account? On Zenly, people mostly share moments of life with their friends. For example, ‘What’s Up (Moments and Memories).’ You can reply, send them your moments (which can be videos or photos), and you can save your sent and received moments to your memory. Except for your friends, no one else can see anything you post. Therefore, the replies received are all from friends. In the small video we sent, friends made very enthusiastic comments.28 ✔️ Are there any concerns that educators should be aware of regarding your platform (privacy, age-inappropriate content, disinformation, misinformation, offensive or illegal content)? Zenly privacy issues has been a controversial topic. Being Zenly friends means you need to share your location, phone battery power with your friends. Educators should be especially aware of privacy issues. Downloading and signing up for a Zenly account means that educators can view their students’ location, time, and battery information anytime, anywhere. To get all of this, educators need to follow students and get their feedback. We can think of this following and following back as request and respect, acknowledgment and permission. I followed you, which means I respect your privacy, so I should request before I get your details. I followed you back, which means I acknowledged our good relationship, so I permitted you to get my private information. However, private information such as a student’s location and phone battery is not very useful for educational purposes. At the same time, educators’ privacy is being exposed. So using Zenly as an educational platform should pay extra attention to privacy issues.29 ✔️ Make note of other things you notice that a curious educator might want to know about your platform. There are also some issues that educators should be aware of. The first point is that Zenly, also a GPS App, has an inaccurate and delayed positioning system. Whether educators are using the platform to observe students’ locations for their safety or as a teaching tool, the inaccuracy can negatively affect education process. The second point is that Zenly can set users location to be fixed. Even if the user is elsewhere, the user can simply locating his Zenly location to his home. This “deception” may protect the privacy of educators and students to a certain extent, but it does not have much positive impact on the education process. Also, since no password is required to create a Zenly account, anyone can use the Zenly account through the user’s device. So academics integrity become a new problem educators need to take into account.30 31 9.5 Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse (you don’t necessarily need to address all of these questions): ✔️ How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media? Instead of being the province of notable elites, public broadcasting of everyday life has become a common and broadly participative activity. The phenomenon of perpetual exposure has undoubtedly become considerably more widespread thanks to social media. Public broadcasting of everyday life has now become a routine and widely attended activity, rather than the preserve of famous elites. Social media has undoubtedly made the phenomenon of constant exposure a more common experience. Celebrities use social media to interact with netizens to promote The effect is also very good. How do they use social media? First, one of the biggest ways celebrities use social media to build their brands is to get closer to their fans. They will often interact with fans. Second, they frequently update themselves on social media. Third, they will use social media to improve the public’s thinking about them, such as promoting some charity on social media, etc.32 ✔️ What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN? The Personal Learning Network (PLN) is a community of colleagues, mentors and experts with whom you can connect to improve your learning and take control of your professional development. PLN is not just a group of friends or family - it is an online community that can be used for many different purposes. The benefits of being in the public eye and having a PLN are many. Because PLN allows you to explore topics you have not been exposed to. And learn and communicate with a lot of people who have experience in that industry. This not only gets rid of the problems of geography and time, but also gives some good help to some special groups who lack education.33 ✔️ Building community with online tools provided by an employer can be limiting, what are some possible restrictions and benefits? There are many benefits to building a community using online tools provided by employers. The Internet is full of various online platforms that can help you connect and build online communities. If you want to create an online community, it’s important to research accessible platforms with features that make it easier for your community to collaborate. The latest technology is crucial to 93 percent of respondents when choosing an employer. Individuals and organizations can gain immediate productivity by utilizing technology that they are comfortable with in their everyday life. However, you should also be aware of some limitations. First, these tools can only be used when you have access to the Internet and a computer or device that is connected to the Internet. If you can’t do this, your organization may not be able to use them. Also, using these tools may not be practical for your organization if you don’t always have access to a computer or device connected to the Internet (for example, if you work in a remote location). Second, even though these tools can be accessed from anywhere, they do require you to have some level of technical knowledge and experience to function properly and effectively. This means that people without technical expertise may find it difficult or impossible to create content on these platforms without the help of others who are experienced in creating content on these platforms.34 ✔️ Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on? There are multiple ways of building a reliable PLN. First, we need to verify the source of information as well as certain websites including the reputation of the publisher and the expertise of the author. Secondly, we need to investigate the reliability of the information by searching coverage claims of certain information. Third, trace the most original source of the information to gain the full idea of certain information. The above steps allow us to follow reliable individual agent and organizations to learn information from various perspectives. We can also seek out building connections with people that our trusted individual agents are following so that we can expand our knowledge furthermore. The self engagement is also very important. Giving the fact that the half-life of information is only half a year long, we need to keep engaging with new materials and information so that we can keep a positive and reliable personal learning network. ✔️ How do those who are veteran story tellers minimize the risk of sharing misinformation? The best way for veteran story tellers minimizing the risk of sharing misinformation would be 1.) Check the source of information to see if it’s credible and reliable, 2.) Verify the information with other reliable and credible sources to improve the credibility of the source, 3.) Thoroughly consider the emotional impact of the content before sharing the story, 4.) Combine data from credible sources with the story telling. 9.6 Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy (including Trust and Disinformation) ✔️ Digital Identity How do you present yourself in social media? Do you have separate identities for personal and work or school use? Do you integrate your personal and professional identities? Do you use different platforms for different purposes? I think it’s important to have a presence on social media. I’m not the best at it, but I try my best. By posting something positive and something worth sharing on social media is a way for me to present myself. I have separate identities for personal and work or school use. For example, I may choose to use different social media software or accounts to separate my personal life and school. In this way, academic content and life content can also be distinguished. People used to be able to easily separate their work and personal lives, but today, thanks in part to social media, these two aspects of life are progressively converging. I have the impression that my personal and professional identities are intertwined. Because my personal interests and life are also factors in my decision to pursue a vocation. I would use different platforms for different purposes. Because some platforms are designed for entertainment, others will be relatively targeted. I will choose the appropriate platform according to different needs. ✔️ Access and Inclusion How does the platform you chose for the Major Project incorporate accessibility and inclusion principles. How are disabled people treated on the platform? Are there multiple ways people can consume or produce content to meet accessibility needs? How do you include those who might otherwise be excluded? Zenly did not specifically introduce how it incorporates accessibility and inclusion principles. Unlike traditional social media apps. Zenly has its own gamified map that allows users to share location with their verified friends.As long as they have enabled location setting, users are able to see the status of their friends’ real-time location as well as battery percentage. It can be used by parents to check their children’s location and also can be used by caretakers to access the location of their patients as well as taking care of the elders with Alzhemiers and dementia. It is easily accessible and does not require any complex logic to master, so Zenly did incorporate accessibility and inclusion principle to some extent. ✔️ Media Literacy, Trust, and Disinformation Does your chosen platform have content moderation policies? Does it flag disinformation, or provide links to trusted resources? How do you ensure that you don’t spread disinformation as misinformation? (Hint: this last question might require you to do a bit of legwork to learn about Media Literacy. This resource should help - but don’t try to read the whole thing!) Zenly emphasizes that Users may not, and may not permit anyone to, use the Service in a manner that. Violate or infringe upon the publication, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of others; bully, harass or intimidate defame; send spam content to other users or engage in marketing practices. However, Zenly does not indicate that they have content moderation policies, which leaves it up to the users to determine the source and reliability of the information. According to Michael A. Caulfield’s WEB LITERACY FOR STUDENT FACT CHECKERS, there are four steps to check the reliability of network information： Check for previous work; Go upstream to the source; Read laterally; Circle back. In addition to all of the above, we still want to call for (a) Establish legal regulations and strengthen media regulation By establishing the relevant legal regulations can the problem of spreading false information be solved at the source. At the same time, we should strengthen the supervision of social media. (b) Improve the quality of the audience and reject secondary dissemination The extensive participation of Internet users in information dissemination activities has produced a lot of negative influences and reduced them to emotional and extremist “rabble.” In social media, the audience has a significant role in disseminating information. The inherent mode of operation of social media, and the function of sharing, give the audience can also become the right to publish. So to reduce and eliminate the spread of false information. The audience should have the ability to identify incorrect information. At the same time, the audience should also have enough awareness to remind others to stop the re-circulation of false information. (c) Establish an authority to release accurate information When false information that is difficult to identify is spreading widely, there is a need for an authoritative institution to analyze the accuracy of the information in detail and take corresponding measures to release official. Authoritative information to stop the continued fermentation and spread of false information as soon as possible.35 36 https://moneyinc.com/zenly-sharing-app/ https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zenly-locator↩︎ https://community.zen.ly/hc/en-us/articles/4404799689361-What-s-Up-Moments-and-Memories-↩︎ Snapchat + Zenly - The Privacy and Security Risks of Location Sharing Apps | Turtler↩︎ What’s special about Zenly, the location app? - Quora↩︎ Zenly - 條款↩︎ https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/how-celebrities-use-social-media-build-their-brand↩︎ https://www.teachhub.com/professional-development/2020/08/how-to-get-a-pln/↩︎ https://www.workplace.com/blog/online-community-management↩︎ Zenly - 條款↩︎ Web Literacy for Student Fact Checkers – Web Literacy for Student Fact-Checkers (pressbooks.com)↩︎ "],["red.html", "Chapter 10 RED 10.1 Personas 10.2 Demographics", " Chapter 10 RED 10.1 Personas 10.2 Demographics Target Audience RED is a Chinese social media and e-commerce platform launched in 2013 with more than 300 million users and monthly active users on RED exceed 200 billion on 2021. Of RED’s 300 million users, about 80% are female and 70% are Millennials or members of Generation Z. Typically those using the app have higher than average disposable income. RED is used by Chinese people in China and around the world. We describe RED as a combination of Instagram, Pinterest and Amazon, where people can review products and share their shopping experiences with a vast community. Users post product photos with reviews and tips for other users to read, comment, and save to their boards as you would on Pinterest. Also, you can follow influencers and shop online within the RED app. 10.2.1 Can non-users browse or search content? For non-users, if you download the app RED on your phone, you are required to create an account in order to browse and search within the platform. However, if you are using the RED’s website, you can have a quick browse of a few selected posts, but it is limited to 1 page, if you wish to browse or search more, you need to download the app. You can browse a post without creating an account only if when an existing users share the post as a link to you. 10.2.2 How are users connected? On RED, if user wants to be connected to another user, you can simply follow them and you can follow anyone without them reciprocating. However, in terms of messaging, if the user you follow did not follow you back, you can only send three messages in total until they follow you back. 10.2.3 Can content be shared privately and how is content shared? Yes, on RED, users can only the content privately use the following options: 1. Directly message to user you follow Users can share the content as a direct message to any user you follow 2. Generate a link or QR code Users can also generate a link or a picture of QR code of the content they wish to share There is also an option to share publicly: 1. Share via another social media platform You can share the content via three Chinese social media platforms: Wechat, QQ and Weibo, RED will first get approved to connect itself to the app user selected, then user can select if they want to share to the social media as a private message or a public post. 10.2.4 How does content go viral? Content on RED can go viral if the post is in the Explore section, which means there will be more users can see the post because most of the users will only browse the Explore section. Also, including a hashtag in the post can also help content to go viral. The screenshot below is an example of the Explore section, and you can tell most of the posts went viral. 10.2.5 Company details RED is founded in Shanghai in 2013 as a user-generated content community, and RED completed Series D fundraising with a valuation of over 3 billion on 2018. The main investors are listed below: 10.2.6 Reference [1] https://www.xiaohongshu.com/en [2] https://www.latmultilingual.com/blog/understanding-red-the-chinese-shopping-app/ "],["major-project-1.html", "Major Project Sign up for a Social Media Platform Create Personas Demographics Privacy and Surveillance Social Media and your PLN in Education Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy (including Trust and Disinformation)", " Major Project Your task in for the project will be to collaboratively create a reflective resource as you build a professional PLN in a particular social media platform. We will add to the project week-by-week and will act as each others’ peer reviewers as we go so that the final result after the next 6 weeks is a user-friendly resource for others seeking information on particular social media platforms. Sign up for a Social Media Platform The first thing we need to do is to have each Learning Pod ‘sign up’ to a particular social media platform. This will be the platform that you use as the basis for your Final Project. The structure of the project is such that we can only have one group working on a particular social media platform, so it will be first-come-first-served for the sign up. GitHub will track the specific time that issues are added and will display the issues in reverse chronological order on the issues page. ✨ Follow These Steps… ✔️ Create an new issue in the Course Repository (not a learner profile, you’ll have to click the ‘Open a blank issue’ link) and add: ✔️ each of your Learning Pod members as assignees ✔️ me as an assignee ✔️ your Learning Pod label ✔️ a new label identifying the social media platform you are signing up for (make sure it isn’t already taken). ✔️ the ‘EDCI338 Major Project’ project. Looks like I will have to do that bit. There are obviously many social network platforms to choose from, some of which are more popular than others. If another pod claims a platform that your pod was hoping to claim, in addition to adding a new label for your second-choice platform, add a comment in your issue and a link to the issue that has already claimed your first-choice platform. We might be able to differentiate your projects enough to allow two groups to explore a single platform. No promises. Create Personas Now that you have chosen a social media platform, it’s time to get organized. The issue that you created in step 1 will become the main home for conversations about your project. Please edit your issue and add the following checklist to the ‘Description’ section… - [ ] Personas - [ ] Demographic Information - [ ] Digital Identity - [ ] Privacy and Surveillance - [ ] Access and Inclusion - [ ] Trust and Misinformation - [ ] Public Discourse - [ ] Education - [ ] Media Literacy - [ ] Reflections You first task is to create as many Personas as there are members in your Learning Pod. The reason for this is to allow everyone the opportunity to create accounts on your platform of choice from behind the curtain of an imagined persona. There are some people who cannot and should not be public on the web, and this is a way to provide some anonymity. You need not engage in research of a typical user on your chosen platform, but simply imagine the characteristics of someone who might want to engage on the platform. I encourage you to imagine a diversity of personas with various characteristics and backgrounds. You can certainly draw from your own experiences as inspiration for your personas, but you are not required to do so. You are welcome to use xtensio.com to create your personas, but other tools like Canva.com may be useful as well. You can use an image from generated.photos/, which generates face images through AI, meaning you don’t have to worry about having to ask someone for permission to use their photo. ✔️ Upload your personas as images to a folder with the name of your social media platform inside the ‘assets’ folder in the course book. ✔️ Embed your persona images on your platform page in the course book. Demographics At this point, you should have ONE person in your learning pod who has forked the course repository and the other members of your learning pod who have been added as collaborators to that fork. GitHub Fork Set-up for each Learning Pod Each Learning Pod will first contribute to their fork of the course repository owned by one of the pod members. Once you have enough content drafted and you’d like to share with the rest of the class, you can open a ‘Pull Request’ in GitHub to send your contributions over to the main course repo. I will be automatically notified and will need to approve these pull requests, so maybe aim for 1 pull request per learning pod per week (we can see how this goes and adjust if necessary)? Make sure you only edit on your own .Rmd page to avoid conflicts in the GitHub content. Your content will show in the course book after it has been merged and I build the book again. Add the following information to your page in the course book. Describe your chosen platform in significant detail, including, as available (Wikipedia may be a good source for some of this info): ✔️ target audience (age, demographics, political leaning, interests, hobbies, etc) ✔️ can non-users browse or search content? ✔️ how are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating) ✔️ can content be shared privately? ✔️ how is content shared? ✔️ how does content go viral? ✔️ is the parent company public or private? ✔️ who are the major investors? ✔️ how does the company generate revenue? ✔️ any other pertinent information… Privacy and Surveillance Download a copy of the platform’s Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy and, as a learning pod, see what you can find out about how the platform uses your data and/or tracks your movements. This will not be the most fun you’ve had. Here are some resources to help you comb through the documents: ✔️ I read the Terms of Service, so that you don’t have to ✔️ Terms of Service; Didn’t Read Add the following to your platform’s page in the course book: ✔️ a link to your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy ✔️ your key takeaways from your examination of your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy Social Media and your PLN in Education In Week Nine, you were instructed to follow some educational accounts in your chosen social media platform. You are encouraged to find a mix of more formal accounts of teachers and administrators in K-12 and faculty and instructors in higher ed (you might also find many accounts of instructional designers and people who work in faculty development), and less formal accounts of people who are sharing their knowledge on the platform outside of formal accredited educational systems. You are also encouraged to set up accounts using the characteristics of the personas that you created a few weeks ago (if you are allowed to create such accounts), and to set up your own accounts to see how different personas ‘experience’ social media differently. Feel free to interact with the educators you follow, either directly or indirectly (each platform will look different). Add the following to your platform’s page in your Learning Pod’s repo: ✔️ Describe how people are able to interact in your platform. Can people leave comments on content? Is there a quick and easy way to ‘Like’ or ‘favourite’ something? Who sees that ‘like?’ Do creators generally respond to comments on their content? ✔️ How do educators use the platform? What kinds of content are they teaching? Who is their audience? Do they respond to comments or questions? Are they using the platform as a PLN, or are they only creating content? ✔️ In your Learning Pod, plan and publish more than one *SHORT educational ‘post’ (whatever that looks like on your platform). Don’t put huge amounts of effort into your post. A simple ‘ProTip’ or ‘LifeHack’ type of post, or a ‘Did you know…[something you know about…].’ Publish your posts on a few of your Learning Pod’s accounts. How do people respond to your post? Do they respond to the same post differently depending on the persona of the account? ✔️ Are there any concerns that educators should be aware of regarding your platform (privacy, age-inappropriate content, disinformation, misinformation, offensive or illegal content)? ✔️ Make note of other things you notice that a curious educator might want to know about your platform. ✔️ By the end of the week, you should have enough content to create a pull request to send your work over to the main course blog, where I will set up some peer reviews (not for grades). Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse In Week Ten you read about Jody Vance and her experience as a high profile woman on social media. Based on her account of her experiences on Twitter, explore your platform for individuals who have high profiles outside your platform. For example, this means Learning Pod 1 should find a few high profile people on TikTok who aren’t just ‘TikTok famous,’ but who have a high profile elsewhere. An example might be a musical artist who happens to be on TikTok, or a politician, etc. Here are some questions to guide your reflections to be added to your Major Project page (you don’t necessarily need to address all of these questions): Add the following to your platform’s page in your Learning Pod’s repo: ✔️ How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media? ✔️ What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN? ✔️ Building community with online tools provided by an employer can be limiting, what are some possible restrictions and benefits? ✔️ Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on? ✔️ How do those who are veteran story tellers minimize the risk of sharing misinformation?

Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age Reference Siemens, G. (2005). Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age. International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 2(1). Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age by George Siemens is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Introduction Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism are the three broad learning theories most often utilized in the creation of instructional environments. These theories, however, were developed in a time when learning was not impacted through technology. Over the last twenty years, technology has reorganized how we live, how we communicate, and how we learn. Learning needs and theories that describe learning principles and processes, should be reflective of underlying social environments. Vaill emphasizes that “learning must be a way of being – an ongoing set of attitudes and actions by individuals and groups that they employ to try to keep abreast of the surprising, novel, messy, obtrusive, recurring events…” (1996, p.42). Learners as little as forty years ago would complete the required schooling and enter a career that would often last a lifetime. Information development was slow. The life of knowledge was measured in decades. Today, these foundational principles have been altered. Knowledge is growing exponentially. In many fields the life of knowledge is now measured in months and years. Gonzalez (2004) describes the challenges of rapidly diminishing knowledge life: “One of the most persuasive factors is the shrinking half-life of knowledge. The “half-life of knowledge” is the time span from when knowledge is gained to when it becomes obsolete. Half of what is known today was not known 10 years ago. The amount of knowledge in the world has doubled in the past 10 years and is doubling every 18 months according to the American Society of Training and Documentation (ASTD). To combat the shrinking half-life of knowledge, organizations have been forced to develop new methods of deploying instruction.” Some significant trends in learning: Many learners will move into a variety of different, possibly unrelated fields over the course of their lifetime. Informal learning is a significant aspect of our learning experience. Formal education no longer comprises the majority of our learning. Learning now occurs in a variety of ways – through communities of practice, personal networks, and through completion of work-related tasks. Learning is a continual process, lasting for a lifetime. Learning and work related activities are no longer separate. In many situations, they are the same. Technology is altering (rewiring) our brains. The tools we use define and shape our thinking. The organization and the individual are both learning organisms. Increased attention to knowledge management highlights the need for a theory that attempts to explain the link between individual and organizational learning. Many of the processes previously handled by learning theories (especially in cognitive information processing) can now be off-loaded to, or supported by, technology. Know-how and know-what is being supplemented with know-where (the understanding of where to find knowledge needed). Background Driscoll (2000) defines learning as “a persisting change in human performance or performance potential…[which] must come about as a result of the learner’s experience and interaction with the world” (p.11). This definition encompasses many of the attributes commonly associated with behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism – namely, learning as a lasting changed state (emotional, mental, physiological (i.e. skills)) brought about as a result of experiences and interactions with content or other people. Driscoll (2000, p14-17) explores some of the complexities of defining learning. Debate centers on: Valid sources of knowledge - Do we gain knowledge through experiences? Is it innate (present at birth)? Do we acquire it through thinking and reasoning? Content of knowledge – Is knowledge actually knowable? Is it directly knowable through human experience? The final consideration focuses on three epistemological traditions in relation to learning: Objectivism, Pragmatism, and Interpretivism Objectivism (similar to behaviorism) states that reality is external and is objective, and knowledge is gained through experiences. Pragmatism (similar to cognitivism) states that reality is interpreted, and knowledge is negotiated through experience and thinking. Interpretivism (similar to constructivism) states that reality is internal, and knowledge is constructed. All of these learning theories hold the notion that knowledge is an objective (or a state) that is attainable (if not already innate) through either reasoning or experiences. Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism (built on the epistemological traditions) attempt to address how it is that a person learns. Behaviorism states that learning is largely unknowable, that is, we can’t possibly understand what goes on inside a person (the “black box theory”). Gredler (2001) expresses behaviorism as being comprised of several theories that make three assumptions about learning: Observable behaviour is more important than understanding internal activities Behaviour should be focused on simple elements: specific stimuli and responses Learning is about behaviour change Cognitivism often takes a computer information processing model. Learning is viewed as a process of inputs, managed in short term memory, and coded for long-term recall. Cindy Buell details this process: “In cognitive theories, knowledge is viewed as symbolic mental constructs in the learner’s mind, and the learning process is the means by which these symbolic representations are committed to memory.” Constructivism suggests that learners create knowledge as they attempt to understand their experiences (Driscoll, 2000, p. 376). Behaviorism and cognitivism view knowledge as external to the learner and the learning process as the act of internalizing knowledge. Constructivism assumes that learners are not empty vessels to be filled with knowledge. Instead, learners are actively attempting to create meaning. Learners often select and pursue their own learning. Constructivist principles acknowledge that real-life learning is messy and complex. Classrooms which emulate the “fuzziness” of this learning will be more effective in preparing learners for life-long learning. Limitations of Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism A central tenet of most learning theories is that learning occurs inside a person. Even social constructivist views, which hold that learning is a socially enacted process, promotes the principality of the individual (and her/his physical presence – i.e. brain-based) in learning. These theories do not address learning that occurs outside of people (i.e. learning that is stored and manipulated by technology). They also fail to describe how learning happens within organizations Learning theories are concerned with the actual process of learning, not with the value of what is being learned. In a networked world, the very manner of information that we acquire is worth exploring. The need to evaluate the worthiness of learning something is a meta-skill that is applied before learning itself begins. When knowledge is subject to paucity, the process of assessing worthiness is assumed to be intrinsic to learning. When knowledge is abundant, the rapid evaluation of knowledge is important. Additional concerns arise from the rapid increase in information. In today’s environment, action is often needed without personal learning – that is, we need to act by drawing information outside of our primary knowledge. The ability to synthesize and recognize connections and patterns is a valuable skill. Many important questions are raised when established learning theories are seen through technology. The natural attempt of theorists is to continue to revise and evolve theories as conditions change. At some point, however, the underlying conditions have altered so significantly, that further modification is no longer sensible. An entirely new approach is needed. Some questions to explore in relation to learning theories and the impact of technology and new sciences (chaos and networks) on learning: How are learning theories impacted when knowledge is no longer acquired in the linear manner? What adjustments need to made with learning theories when technology performs many of the cognitive operations previously performed by learners (information storage and retrieval). How can we continue to stay current in a rapidly evolving information ecology? How do learning theories address moments where performance is needed in the absence of complete understanding? What is the impact of networks and complexity theories on learning? What is the impact of chaos as a complex pattern recognition process on learning? With increased recognition of interconnections in differing fields of knowledge, how are systems and ecology theories perceived in light of learning tasks? An Alternative Theory Including technology and connection making as learning activities begins to move learning theories into a digital age. We can no longer personally experience and acquire learning that we need to act. We derive our competence from forming connections. Karen Stephenson states: “Experience has long been considered the best teacher of knowledge. Since we cannot experience everything, other people’s experiences, and hence other people, become the surrogate for knowledge. ‘I store my knowledge in my friends’ is an axiom for collecting knowledge through collecting people (undated).” Chaos is a new reality for knowledge workers. ScienceWeek (2004) quotes Nigel Calder’s definition that chaos is “a cryptic form of order.” Chaos is the breakdown of predictability, evidenced in complicated arrangements that initially defy order. Unlike constructivism, which states that learners attempt to foster understanding by meaning making tasks, chaos states that the meaning exists – the learner’s challenge is to recognize the patterns which appear to be hidden. Meaning-making and forming connections between specialized communities are important activities. Chaos, as a science, recognizes the connection of everything to everything. Gleick (1987) states: “In weather, for example, this translates into what is only half-jokingly known as the Butterfly Effect – the notion that a butterfly stirring the air today in Peking can transform storm systems next month in New York” (p. 8). This analogy highlights a real challenge: “sensitive dependence on initial conditions” profoundly impacts what we learn and how we act based on our learning. Decision making is indicative of this. If the underlying conditions used to make decisions change, the decision itself is no longer as correct as it was at the time it was made. The ability to recognize and adjust to pattern shifts is a key learning task. Luis Mateus Rocha (1998) defines self-organization as the “spontaneous formation of well organized structures, patterns, or behaviors, from random initial conditions.” (p.3). Learning, as a self-organizing process requires that the system (personal or organizational learning systems) “be informationally open, that is, for it to be able to classify its own interaction with an environment, it must be able to change its structure…” (p.4). Wiley and Edwards acknowledge the importance of self-organization as a learning process: “Jacobs argues that communities self-organize is a manner similar to social insects: instead of thousands of ants crossing each other’s pheromone trails and changing their behavior accordingly, thousands of humans pass each other on the sidewalk and change their behavior accordingly.” Self-organization on a personal level is a micro-process of the larger self-organizing knowledge constructs created within corporate or institutional environments. The capacity to form connections between sources of information, and thereby create useful information patterns, is required to learn in our knowledge economy. Networks, Small Worlds, Weak Ties A network can simply be defined as connections between entities. Computer networks, power grids, and social networks all function on the simple principle that people, groups, systems, nodes, entities can be connected to create an integrated whole. Alterations within the network have ripple effects on the whole. Albert-László Barabási states that “nodes always compete for connections because links represent survival in an interconnected world” (2002, p.106). This competition is largely dulled within a personal learning network, but the placing of value on certain nodes over others is a reality. Nodes that successfully acquire greater profile will be more successful at acquiring additional connections. In a learning sense, the likelihood that a concept of learning will be linked depends on how well it is currently linked. Nodes (can be fields, ideas, communities) that specialize and gain recognition for their expertise have greater chances of recognition, thus resulting in cross-pollination of learning communities. Weak ties are links or bridges that allow short connections between information. Our small world networks are generally populated with people whose interests and knowledge are similar to ours. Finding a new job, as an example, often occurs through weak ties. This principle has great merit in the notion of serendipity, innovation, and creativity. Connections between disparate ideas and fields can create new innovations. Connectivism Connectivism is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories. Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous environments of shifting core elements – not entirely under the control of the individual. Learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an organization or a database), is focused on connecting specialized information sets, and the connections that enable us to learn more are more important than our current state of knowing. Connectivism is driven by the understanding that decisions are based on rapidly altering foundations. New information is continually being acquired. The ability to draw distinctions between important and unimportant information is vital. The ability to recognize when new information alters the landscape based on decisions made yesterday is also critical. Principles of connectivism: Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions. Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources. Learning may reside in non-human appliances. Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning. Ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill. Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities. Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision. Connectivism also addresses the challenges that many corporations face in knowledge management activities. Knowledge that resides in a database needs to be connected with the right people in the right context in order to be classified as learning. Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism do not attempt to address the challenges of organizational knowledge and transference. Information flow within an organization is an important element in organizational effectiveness. In a knowledge economy, the flow of information is the equivalent of the oil pipe in an industrial economy. Creating, preserving, and utilizing information flow should be a key organizational activity. Knowledge flow can be likened to a river that meanders through the ecology of an organization. In certain areas, the river pools and in other areas it ebbs. The health of the learning ecology of the organization depends on effective nurturing of information flow. Social network analysis is an additional element in understanding learning models in a digital era. Art Kleiner (2002) explores Karen Stephenson’s “quantum theory of trust” which “explains not just how to recognize the collective cognitive capability of an organization, but how to cultivate and increase it.” Within social networks, hubs are well-connected people who are able to foster and maintain knowledge flow. Their interdependence results in effective knowledge flow, enabling the personal understanding of the state of activities organizationally. The starting point of connectivism is the individual. Personal knowledge is comprised of a network, which feeds into organizations and institutions, which in turn feed back into the network, and then continue to provide learning to individual. This cycle of knowledge development (personal to network to organization) allows learners to remain current in their field through the connections they have formed. Landauer and Dumais (1997) explore the phenomenon that “people have much more knowledge than appears to be present in the information to which they have been exposed.” They provide a connectivist focus in stating “the simple notion that some domains of knowledge contain vast numbers of weak interrelations that, if properly exploited, can greatly amplify learning by a process of inference.” The value of pattern recognition and connecting our own “small worlds of knowledge” are apparent in the exponential impact provided to our personal learning. John Seely Brown presents an interesting notion that the internet leverages the small efforts of many with the large efforts of few. The central premise is that connections created with unusual nodes supports and intensifies existing large effort activities. Brown provides the example of a Maricopa County Community College system project that links senior citizens with elementary school students in a mentor program. The children “listen to these “grandparents” better than they do their own parents, the mentoring really helps the teachers…the small efforts of the many- the seniors – complement the large efforts of the few – the teachers.” (2002). This amplification of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension of a personal network is the epitome of connectivism. Implications The notion of connectivism has implications in all aspects of life. This paper largely focuses on its impact on learning, but the following aspects are also impacted: Management and leadership. The management and marshalling of resources to achieve desired outcomes is a significant challenge. Realizing that complete knowledge cannot exist in the mind of one person requires a different approach to creating an overview of the situation. Diverse teams of varying viewpoints are a critical structure for completely exploring ideas. Innovation is also an additional challenge. Most of the revolutionary ideas of today at one time existed as a fringe element. An organizations ability to foster, nurture, and synthesize the impacts of varying views of information is critical to knowledge economy survival. Speed of “idea to implementation” is also improved in a systems view of learning. Media, news, information. This trend is well under way. Mainstream media organizations are being challenged by the open, real-time, two-way information flow of blogging. Personal knowledge management in relation to organizational knowledge management Design of learning environments Conclusion The pipe is more important than the content within the pipe. Our ability to learn what we need for tomorrow is more important than what we know today. A real challenge for any learning theory is to actuate known knowledge at the point of application. When knowledge, however, is needed, but not known, the ability to plug into sources to meet the requirements becomes a vital skill. As knowledge continues to grow and evolve, access to what is needed is more important than what the learner currently possesses. Connectivism presents a model of learning that acknowledges the tectonic shifts in society where learning is no longer an internal, individualistic activity. How people work and function is altered when new tools are utilized. The field of education has been slow to recognize both the impact of new learning tools and the environmental changes in what it means to learn. Connectivism provides insight into learning skills and tasks needed for learners to flourish in a digital era. References Barabási, A.

Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement. First Monday. Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement by Dave S. White and Alison Le Cornu is marked with CC0 1.0 Abstract This article proposes a continuum of ‘Visitors’ and ‘Residents’ as a replacement for Prensky’s much‐criticised Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants. Challenging the basic premises upon which Prensky constructed his typology, Visitors and Residents fulfil a similar purpose in mapping individuals’ engagement with the Web. We argue that the metaphors of ‘place’ and ‘tool’ most appropriately represent the use of technology in contemporary society, especially given the advent of social media. The Visitors and Residents continuum accounts for people behaving in different ways when using technology, depending on their motivation and context, without categorising them according to age or background. A wider and more accurate representation of online behaviour is therefore established. Introduction ‘The digital natives/digital immigrants distinction is dead or at least dying.’ So proclaims Doug Holton in his blogpost. He continues: ‘Unfortunately, the idea is still uncritically accepted even in some journal articles, and perhaps used as an excuse or crutch too often for poor or ineffective teaching practices.’ Holton is not alone in his criticism. McKenzie (2007) writes strongly against Prensky’s (2001a, b) typology identifying a number of ‘thinly supported claims,’ while Kennedy, et al. (2010) demonstrate through an empirical research project that Prensky’s age–related hypothesis is very much less clear–cut than the Natives and Immigrants dichotomy implies. Our intention in this article is to propose an alternative, which we have termed ‘Visitors and Residents.’ Prensky’s distinction between people who are entirely at ease within a digital environment and those who manage to learn to exist but who (in his view) will never be fully competent, has gained enormous currency and, until recently, widespread acceptance. Similarly, his linked assertion that the differentiation also signals the need for an educational revolution, requiring a new approach which accommodates the up–and–coming Natives, has not only been largely believed but has provoked a sense of panic among ‘Immigrant educators’ who now perceive themselves wrong–footed and unable to step up to the plate. Prensky himself has expressed doubts over the validity of his thinking (Prensky, 2009). Nor is he the first to try and analyse perceived behaviours of learners by categorising them into types. The benefits of so doing, as well as the disadvantages, are well recognised: benefits are that these categories allow others to use this new knowledge to augment the learning experience; disadvantages focus principally on the inflexibility of types, as well as the tendency to box individuals into one type or another, overlooking contradictory evidence. Theories of learning styles favour typologies of this sort, as do certain theories of human development, and many struggle to allow individuals the space simultaneously to exhibit traits characteristic of different types. Why, then, would we want to propose an alternative to Prensky’s Natives and Immigrants? Firstly, we recognise the usefulness of these typologies, despite their drawbacks. Secondly, we feel that although many criticisms of Prensky are valid, he initiated an important dialogue and offered a framework which those concerned with the quality and effectiveness of education delivered electronically could use. He was one of the first to do this in a fast–moving domain and this contribution should be acknowledged. His Natives and Immigrants were hypothetical children of their time, however, and we believe that as our understanding has developed, it is appropriate to re–evaluate what was previously accepted and to change it to suit the purposes of today. Not only so, but there are many instances — to the point, perhaps, of being a general and widespread habit — where Prensky’s ideas on Natives and Immigrants have been inappropriately transported into a social media context, paradoxically finding themselves as ‘immigrants’ in a new land. We introduce our discussion in section II by critiquing Prensky’s Natives and Immigrants with a specific focus on the nature of the metaphor. The section also suggests that in the ten years since Prensky published his Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants (2001), technology, computer applications, and hence the way in which education takes place, have moved on to the point that the Native/Immigrant dichotomy is now redundant. In section III we explore new metaphors of tool, place and space, and, in section IV, therefore, we present our alternative which builds on yet replaces one of the underdeveloped strengths in Prensky’s typology using in particular, the metaphor of place. We make the assumption of familiarity with Prenky’s work and for that reason do not summarise it here [1]. Prensky’s Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants: A critique Metaphors: Language and age Key to Prensky’s typology is the connection he made between computing competence and age. In his original paper, he writes: What should we call these “new” students of today? Some refer to them as the N–[for Net]–gen or D–[for digital]–gen. But the most useful designation I have found for them is Digital Natives. Our students today are all “native speakers” of the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet. So what does that make the rest of us? Those of us who were not born into the digital world but have, at some later point in our lives, become fascinated by and adopted many or most aspects of the new technology are, and always will be compared to them, Digital Immigrants The importance of the distinction is this: As Digital Immigrants learn — like all immigrants, some better than others — to adapt to their environment, they always retain, to some degree, their “accent,” that is, their foot in the past. The “digital immigrant accent” can be seen in such things as turning to the Internet for information second rather than first, or in reading the manual for a program rather than assuming that the program itself will teach us to use it. Today’s older folk were “socialized” differently from their kids, and are now in the process of learning a new language. And a language learned later in life, scientists tell us, goes into a different part of the brain. [2] Prensky’s language–based analogy is compelling and it is easy to see why it quickly commanded attention. Recently, however, challenges have been mounted that separate the two dimensions and call into question, in particular, whether it is genuinely the case firstly that older learners are really as handicapped as Prensky suggests, and secondly that younger learners are as privileged as he understands them to be. Ten years on, evidence and logic challenge both positions, with, for example, comments such as the following from Bennett, et al. (2008): Though limited in scope and focus, the research evidence to date indicates that a proportion of young people are highly adept with technology and rely on it for a range of information gathering and communication activities. However, there also appears to be a significant proportion of young people who do not have the levels of access or technology skills predicted by proponents of the digital native idea. Such generalisations about a whole generation of young people thereby focus attention on technically adept students. With this comes the danger that those less interested and less able will be neglected, and that the potential impact of socio–economic and cultural factors will be overlooked. It may be that there is as much variation within the digital native generation as between the generations. [3] Similarly, Margaryan and Littlejohn write: Many young students are far from being the epitomic global, connected, socially networked technologically–fluent digital native who has little patience for passive and linear forms of learning. While the use of technologies is limited in terms of the range and the nature, there is some evidence that younger students use some tools more actively than the older students, but neither of these two groups uses these technologies to support their learning effectively. Educators therefore cannot presume that all young students are “digital natives” who understand how to use technology to support and enhance their learning. [4] It is increasingly clear that, just as is the case for almost every subject discipline and expertise, some learners will acquire the requisite skills quickly, while others will struggle, regardless of age. It is also significant that formal bodies which regularly survey Internet use, such as Oxford Internet Surveys (OxIS), do not use specifically age–related categories for their data collection, but rather life–stage categories. The majority of OxIS 2009 surveys on The Internet in Britain focus on students, employed and retired people, making no inferences about any commensurate age–related dimensions. The implication is that each category is equally technologically competent, but their respective life–stage leads them to different types of use. For the purposes of this paper our goal is not to disprove Prensky’s thesis per se, but instead to challenge the underlying metaphor of language– and second–language–learning which he builds his case on, and then to offer an alternative. We want to ask questions such as: Can learning technological skills be likened to that of language learning? Is the analogy appropriate? If not, can another more appropriate metaphor be identified? It is undoubtedly significant that there has been a move towards speaking of digital literacies (rather than, for example, digital languages) in recent years. Lankshear and Knobel (2008) draw attention to the move from the singular ‘literacy’ to the plural ‘literacies,’ a move of which they approve on account of, amongst other things, &amp;rlsquo;the sheer diversity of specific accounts of “digital literacy” that exist, and consequent implications of that for digital literacy policies’ [5]. They also provide a useful summary of the ways in which ‘digital literacy’ has been interpreted and used. These include: Mastering ideas, not keystrokes (Bawden, 2008, citing Gilster, 1997) Conceptual definitions as distinct from standardized operational definitions (Lankshear and Knobel, 2006) Individuals’ ability to participate in a multimodal culture (Jenkins, et al., 2006) Lankshear and Knobel conclude [6]: This sheer variety means that digital literacy can be seen as “a framework for integrating various other literacies and skill–sets” without “the need to encompass them all” or to serve as “one literacy to rule them all” (Martin cited in Bawden, Chapter 1 here; Martin, 2006). Equally, however, it reminds us that any attempt to constitute an umbrella definition or overarching frame of digital literacy will necessarily involve reconciling the claims of myriad concepts of digital literacy, a veritable legion of digital literacies. There are undoubtedly similarities between mastering this range of literacies and learning a second language, although research about precisely how people learn a new language in adulthood constitutes a complete field in its own right and cannot be explored here. Yet this still seems not to be Prensky’s principal focus. Instead, he targets the foreign accent which remains and which will always be the giveaway of someone’s background and origins. For him, the accent is a matter of habit or of first course of action. So, as the above quote demonstrates, the instinct not to go to the Internet (presumably in favour of using a paper–based encyclopedia) when searching for information, or the tendency to read an instruction manual (also paper–based) rather than work out how something functions by trial and error, are both recognisable ‘accents.’ Once again, it is easy to challenge these assertions. Now that the Internet has been in widespread use in educational establishments for around 15 years, it has clearly become the source of information chosen first by seekers, regardless of age [7]. In many cases the Internet is now the sole up-to-date source of information, and certainly the sole source which offers much free–of–charge. Secondly, reading an instruction manual for other tasks (assembling flat–packed furniture, using a new piece of machinery for the first time, getting to know a new smart phone, etc.) is often a last resort once again for people of all ages. In this paper we demonstrate that that Prensky was: a) over hasty in appropriating an analogy which cannot bear the weight required of it; and, b) imprecise in his combination of diverse elements (second–language learning, accent, habit and age, linking all these to brain development) which cannot be legitimately combined to make his case. We seek to propose an alternative, highlighting how the advent of social media has dramatically changed the terrain of computer–mediated education, which in turn has enabled us to place a different metaphor, that of ‘place,’ at centre stage and offer the analogy of Visitors and Residents as alternatives to Digital Natives and Immigrants. Towards a new metaphor of engagement with online technology Prensky’s Natives and Immigrants pre–date the launching of what are now commonly known as social media applications. The social bookmarking site Delicious, for example, was launched in 2003 as was MySpace. Both Facebook and World of Warcraft [8] launched in 2004; Bebo and YouTube in 2005; and, Twitter in 2006. Prior to 2003, the Internet was used primarily as a means of finding information with Google leading the way since 1997 in offering an effective means of searching for and gathering information. A key distinction between information–gathering versus social–networking sites is that the latter invite individuals to project their personas online as a ‘digital identity’ via text, image and video. Furthermore, social media platforms facilitate the construction, by the individual, of complex social networks not constrained by physical geography. These are critical shifts in the use of the internet which we suggest are transforming the nature of relationships, citizenship and learning. In response to these changes the metaphors which we suggest best represent the engagement with online technology now widely experienced are those of ‘tool’ and ‘place/space.’ This section looks at both. Certain platforms on the Web fit quite neatly under the metaphor of ‘tool,’ while others are more closely aligned to the metaphor of ‘place.’ ‘Tool’ is functional and may provide a bridge between Prensky’s understanding of how people used computer technology and that which we propose. ‘Place,’ on the other hand, is social. Increasingly, the two overlap. The metaphors of tool, place and space Until recently, with the exception of gaming, computing was almost solely linked to ideas of efficiency and goal–orientated functionality. Only now are we witnessing the social appropriation of new computing technologies. Microsoft’s Office suite is an excellent example of this, as well as of the skills that people needed to use the applications effectively. Each application had — and has — a specific purpose that enabled users to do something. It functioned as a tool, a means to an end; users learned and practised skills, developing varying degrees of competence and confidence in achieving their desired ends. Despite numerous iterations of these platforms and of computing operating systems, a set of generally–accepted principles of good practice emerged relating to what users needed and how they could access this most effectively, with the result that users could develop a set of transferable skills applicable across a range of platforms and become computer literate. In the abrupt cultural shift towards the construction of social networks, we argue that the analogies of language and age cease to function and believe that a metaphor of place is more fit for the purpose of understanding different behaviours and potentially aptitudes. The use of ‘place’ as a metaphor to conceptualise the ‘virtual’ nature of the Web is not new (see Johnston, 2009; Wenger, et al., 2009). However, our definition of place does not make a hard distinction between the virtual and the physical; on the contrary, we are proposing that place is primarily a sense of being present with others. A sense of social presence (White and Le Cornu, 2010) is something those who spend time on social media platforms experience to a high level, with the effect of foregrounding a broad sense of digital identity. This in turn results in a type of personification within social media spaces as people project aspects of their identity to an imagined audience (see Marwick and boyd, 2010). The social dimension of computing has brought about a paradigm shift in many individuals’ experience of computer use as well as influenced their attitude and motivation towards the use and purpose of connected digital technologies. The metaphor of ‘place’ is therefore one which lends itself very easily to the experience people have when they are engaged and interacting socially with others via a computer. It is not uncommon to hear people asking each other if they have ‘been’ ‘in’ to Facebook today, for example. One of the key features is the fact that people can still meet in an area common to all of them, and for that reason an impression of location and of social space is created. Just as physical, geographical places have architectural characteristics and town planners can make a real–life city more, or less, user–friendly to navigate, so software designers are responsible for the navigability of platforms, and Facebook users are familiar with the frustration of suddenly ‘losing their way’ when the platform is upgraded and changed. In all of these experiences, the metaphors of space and place are used to describe what is going on. The distinction between and shift from people’s appropriation of computer programmes as tools to thinking of platforms as social spaces is clearly identifiable in an application such as Google Docs. In its original basic form, Google Docs offers a functional tool whereby users can create documents and make them available to others. While this is happening at an individual level, the application remains a tool. As soon as another person, or people, join in and participate in editing and sharing in the creation of the document, a social place is created. Users can reconsider their actions in a kind of social context, discussing with each other aspects of the document and experiencing a social dimension as well as functional. We therefore argue that tools, places and spaces are the three key metaphors that most aptly describe the experience of computer users in a world where social media are becoming more and more prevalent. We suggest that Prenksy’s understanding of ‘place’ was limited and tagged to his principal metaphor of language; we are now suggesting that this metaphor should be appropriately contextualised and to occupy centre stage in any discussion about how people interact with each other and with content when both are electronically mediated, and be linked to the metaphor of tool. This then allows the formulation of a new typology, that of Visitors and Residents. These are explored in the next section. Visitors and Residents Visitors We propose that Visitors understand the Web as akin to an untidy garden tool shed. They have defined a goal or task and go into the shed to select an appropriate tool which they use to attain their goal. Task over, the tool is returned to the shed. It may not have been perfect for the task, but they are happy to make do so long as some progress is made. This is important, since Visitors need to see some concrete benefit resulting from their use of the platform. Significantly, Visitors are unlikely to have any form of persistent profile online which projects their identity into the digital space. They are anonymous, their activity invisible to all but the databases running the Web sites they use. Individuals who most closely fit the Visitor approach give a number of reasons for not wanting a ‘digital identity’ which would persist in some form even when they were not online. Issues of privacy and fear of identity theft are paramount [9] but there is also a sense that social networking activities are banal and egotistical. Implicit in this is the idea that if you have a ‘real’ social life and network of friends then you wouldn’t choose to socialise online in a visible manner. It is this visibility, or the ‘broadcast’ nature of the visibility, which is key; Visitors are not averse to using e–mail or Skype to maintain relationships but they are wary of creating a Facebook profile. Visitors then see the Web as primarily a set of tools which deliver or manipulate content (this can include the content of a conversation because, as mentioned, they are happy to accept the Web as a useful conduit for interpersonal communication). This content is often distanced as far as possible from personal opinion (unless a competent authority is in evidence or a pre–existing off–line relationship). In effect, the ‘non–referenced’ or non–expert opinion and notions such as the wisdom of the crowd are avoided. Ultimately to Visitors the Web is simply one of many tools they can use to achieve certain goals; it is categorised alongside the telephone, books, pen and paper and off–line software. It is not a ‘place’ to think or to develop ideas and to put it crudely, and at its most extreme, Visitors do their thinking off–line. So Visitors are users, not members, of the Web and place little value in belonging online. Residents Residents, on the other hand, see the Web as a place, perhaps like a park or a building in which there are clusters of friends and colleagues whom they can approach and with whom they can share information about their life and work. A proportion of their lives is actually lived out online where the distinction between online and off–line is increasingly blurred. Residents are happy to go online simply to spend time with others and they are likely to consider that they ‘belong’ to a community which is located in the virtual. They have a profile in social networking platforms such as Facebook or Twitter and are comfortable expressing their persona in these online spaces. To Residents, the Web is a place to express opinions, a place in which relationships can be formed and extended. While they use ‘tools’ such as online banking and shopping systems they also use the Web to maintain and develop a digital identity. Since they also undertake many of the activities that Visitors do, their residency is an additional layer of interaction and activity. When Residents log off, an aspect of their persona remains. This could be in many forms ranging from status updates to social networking platforms, to artefacts in media sharing sites or opinions expressed in blog posts or blog comments. Residents see the Web primarily as a network of individuals or clusters of individuals who in turn generate content. Value online is assessed in terms of relationships as well as knowledge. Residents do not make a clear distinction between concepts of content and of persona. A blog post is as much an expression of identity as it is a discussion of particular ideas. The fact that Wikipedia has been authored collectively is not a concern, what is important is how relevant the information they find is to their particular needs. Discussion Our Visitors and Residents typology should be understood as a continuum and not a binary opposition. Individuals may be able to place themselves at a particular point along this continuum rather than in one of two boxes. Nor is a predominantly Visitor approach necessarily any less effective or of less value than a predominantly Resident approach since the value of either has to be set against a given context and set of goals. Similarly, we do not consider the Visitor to be necessarily any less technically adept than the Resident. The concept of ‘technical’ aptitude should be viewed as more than simply an ability to manipulate hardware and software. It is more useful to think of the ‘technical’ as extending into skill sets required by a given discipline, such as the ability to research a given topic. This definition of the technical then intersects with the notion of digital literacy which is a more useful framework to assess the value of given approaches, the relative merits of which are discussed in reports such as Beetham, et al.’s (2009) LLiDA project and Gillen and Barton’s (2010) Digital literacies (PDF). A simple reading of this typology might lead one to believe that the category of Visitor is somehow a subset of that of Resident or that the goal of Visitors should be to extend their skills towards the Resident end of the continuum. Stoerger (2009) introduces this idea in her ‘digital melting pot’ analogy by suggesting that Web users with a range of competencies can simply learn from each other by mingling in shared spaces on the Web. This does not take into account the motivation behind a type of engagement with the Web, however, and assumes, again, that technical aptitude is directly linked to being ‘successful’ in the online environment. Nevertheless, it is often much more efficient to research a particular topic in such a way that meets the needs of traditional educational requirements (essays, exams) if a Visitor approach is taken. Visitors’ technical and intellectual skills in the pursuit of specific content may well be significantly more sophisticated than Residents’, regardless of their age (and here we specifically challenge Prensky’s belief that older people will never achieve as high a degree of technical aptitude as younger people). Similarly it has been suggested that aptitude in social media platforms often does not translate into other online spaces or tools (Stoerger, 2009), although this is difficult to quantify. Residents’ ability to engage with ‘new’ platforms in ways in which appear culturally novel or radical does not equip them to negotiate Wikipedia or an online library catalogue successfully either in terms of functionality or the literacy skills required. The literacy required is not simply one of off–line/online or gamer/non–gamer; online literacies differ between platforms, although to an outsider the skills required may seem equivalent and there is a certain commonality in the acquisition of transferable skills. However, the notion of social networking platforms masks the fact that for many ‘expert’ Facebook users Twitter is relatively undecipherable. At one level this can be accounted for by the difference in functionality, but it also relates to the literacies required for the respective platforms, together with the motivation. The two platforms serve quite different purposes. It would be easy simply to categorise individuals at a particular point along the Visitor/Resident continuum with some indication of their potential direction of travel. This labelling of individuals as a single type or as representing a single form of behaviour is where, as mentioned earlier, the nature of a typology can fall down. As Wenger (1998) has highlighted, we are all members of multiple communities and have to negotiate our roles and identities as we navigate the ‘nexus’ of communities we belong to. In a similar manner an individual’s approach to the Web is likely to change dependent on context. For example, an individual might take a Resident approach in their private life but a Visitor approach in their role as a professional. Similarly it is not unusual for someone in a leadership role in a special interest group to manage that responsibility in a Resident style online while in a personal or professional context they choose to act as a Visitor. Individuals are generally very good at managing their differing approaches across contexts and have much experience of similar shifts in attitude and motivation as they move between roles played out in physical spaces. However, the ubiquity of the Web across these traditional physical boundaries is beginning to pose challenges, blurring the boundaries of traditional contexts, which Marwick and boyd (2010) describe as ‘context collapse.’ A good example of this is the Visitor tutor/academic whose rather more Resident personal life is discovered by their students. There is growing evidence (e.g., boyd, 2008; Helsper and Eynon, 2009; Tenopir and Rowlands, 2007; CiBER, 2007) that while age may be less of a factor in technology use than Prensky envisaged, factors such as conceptions of privacy and the notions of friendship may be shifting generationally. In fact the cultural effects of the social hyperconnectivity brought about by social media and mobile devices are often masked by shallow assessments of technological functionality and the apparent capability of specific groups in consuming ‘new’ technology. Conclusion We propose that our Visitors and Residents paradigm not only describes the lived experience and practice of technological engagement in a more accurate way than Prensky’s Natives and Immigrants, but it is based on a more secure foundation. Our typology of Visitors and Residents turn to the metaphor of place to provide an analytic framework, but the strength of moving away from language and accent and placing the emphasis on motivation allows for a wide variety of practices which span all age groups and does not require individuals to be boxed, inexorably, in one category or the other. Both ‘place’ and ‘tool’ have the capacity to incorporate motivation. Questions such as: ‘What am I going there for?’ ‘What am I hoping to achieve?’ ‘Which place best serves my purpose?’ ‘How long do I intend to stay?’ ‘Have I got the skills that I need?’ and ‘Am I happy to be on my own, or would I prefer to be in company?’ all fit within the Visitors and Residents paradigm and transcend issues such as age, technological ‘geekishness,’ and the development of the brain, while still recognising that individuals may have a greater or less well developed natural aptitude for using technology and that some may never move (we avoid the term ‘progress’) beyond a low–level engagement of selecting a small range of tools for a limited number of purposes. Another strength of the paradigm is our understanding of it as a continuum along the lines of that depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Visitors and Residents Clearly, some people may operate entirely as Visitors, visiting specific Web places for specific purposes, entirely on their own and never leaving a footprint behind. At the other extreme, ‘total’ Residents (equally small in number, we suggest) spend all their online time in social interaction, never using the Internet for information–gathering yet leaving behind significant evidence of their presence. More representative of the majority of Internet use is that which takes place within the central box. Individuals move around the box, sometimes functioning more as Visitors, sometimes more as Residents, according to their motivation. Prensky made a deliberate connection between his Natives and Immigrants and people’s learning styles, preferences, and ultimately, abilities. Our Visitors and Residents paradigm also has educational implications that we have been unable to explore in this paper, but which we do in a following paper. In this, we shall look at understanding and setting expectations, practical aspects to bear in mind when engaging students online (especially when dealing with a large cohort, which is often the case), and explore some of the ways in which Visitors and Residents interacts with current understandings of and calls for digital literacy.
