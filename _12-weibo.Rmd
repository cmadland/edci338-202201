For example, Weibo users can upload their Weibo stories and texts to share their daily life, and their visitors and followers are able to show their Likes and Comments on the post. They can also repost their favorite contents with the reference of the original authors. Moreover, Weibo users are also able to join topic groups, such as painting groups and cat groups.

## Social Media and your PLN in Education

### ✔️ The Interaction between Users

People choose to interact with others through a variety of ways, which depend on their personal preferences. Some people tend to text with pictures and emojis,  and others may choose to post videos to share their current moods and daily life. In terms of the time limit of the posted videos, they should be within 15 minutes. Meanwhile, the viewers are able to make comments on content to express their opinions, which is a nice way to foster communication among people. The viewers can also repost their favorite contents with the references of the original authors so that more people are going to engage in the hot topic. 

Moreover, the viewers can show their likes of their favorite contents by  pressing the “Like” button. They usually show their likes when they notice some humorous topics. They can also search their interested topics on Weibo’s search area, which helps people quickly find their favorite contents. In addition, everyone on Weibo is able to see the likes and comments of contents when the creators are not showing their posts in a private setting. The creators generally respond to comments, and interesting and thoughtful comments easily attract them to reply. Besides, people can also chat privately on the dialogue page, which allows them to have a one-to-one communication.

### ✔️ Typical Users:  Educators 

Educators can register an account with Weibo and share their content on the platform. There are all types of bloggers on Weibo, such as culture, make up, cook food, photography, and so on. They have an audience of people who want to learn this type of knowledge. The bloggers all read the comments of the audience and answer their questions. This approach improves the quality of the video and communicates well with the audience. Most educators use Weibo to create

### ✔️ Feedback from Weibo Posts

We made separate posts about the same life tips on different Weibo accounts,  which is 'Do you know what your standard weight is? ' and 'How to calculate your BMI'. After the release, it can be seen that the age group of active users of Weibo is 16-35 years old. The ages of our characters are 18, 25, 32, 46 and 58. By comparing posts 18, 25 and 32 have more replies to posts, and 58 has few replies. People are very interested in the weight corresponding to height at different ages, and they are more interested in learning about physical health. Users between the ages of 14 and 30 are concerned about whether their body is in good shape, and most users over 30 are concerned about whether they are overweight. And most of the people who reply to the posts published in each age group are people of the corresponding age group. Over 77% of Weibo users are aged 14-40, and most people who use the software want to get news, entertainment and daily life information.

### ✔️ Educators’ Concerns on Weibo

The management of Weibo is very strict. For example, sensitive words are not allowed, posts will be deleted if disinformation is posted, and accounts will be blocked in serious cases. However, the privacy issue of Weibo may not be solved very well, because nowadays, not only the phone number but also the ID and name of the person are required to register Weibo. The purpose of this is for the healthy development of youth education and better targeting of those who post disinformation. Overall, there are pros and cons. Therefore, educators need to be aware of these issues at all times in order to develop a better platform.

## Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse

### How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media?

In Weibo, the function of high-profile individuals using Weibo is to bring more attention to themselves. When some fans know that their favorite idols start to share their life and photos online, they will always pay attention and bring some topics for them. When they have new tv shows or albums, Weibo is a good platform for publicity, which can also be seen by some people who do not know them and attract more people's attention.

High-profile individuals and celebrities use their social media platforms differently than regular people. They utilize social media platforms, mostly like brands, where they market their products on such platforms. In this case, high-profile individuals or celebrities will utilize these platforms to market their content, movies, or music (Yoakam, 2019). The platforms are used in such a way that they draw attention to their work, and they also receive feedback regarding their work. There is also the chance for these individuals to express themselves. 

### What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN?

The benefit is that you can see yourself through the public eye and you can see the public from a personal point of view.
It is essential to be on a PLN and in the public eye because it helps in the development of relationships. Through a PLN, an individual can ask for information and get valuable feedback from peers (Arsarkij & Laohajaratsang, 2021). It is also possible to share content you have developed and other information enhanced through feedback from peers. Through a PLN, an individual can also increase their flexibility because you are able to decide the regularity of connecting with the online community. 

### Limitations and Benefits of Weibo

The community built using online social media has certain limitations, and all the software used in China is monitored by the government, so this leads to some limitations. China does not allow inappropriate remarks on social media, such as insulting the country, illegal, pornography, etc. are all illegal content. If people want to discuss some sexual knowledge with community members on Weibo, post with overly pornographic words and the post will be deleted by Weibo administrators. There is absolutely no problem discussing national politics and gender relations on Weibo. But if you want to search on Weibo for specific drug words like marijuana, white powder, or cocaine, you won't find them, which are all illegal words (drugs are illegal in China). Searching for 'drugs' can find some videos and articles of police anti-drugs, as well as knowledge of drug popularization. There are many minors on Weibo, so that they can grow up healthy and stay away from pornography, gambling and drugs. And people tend to get more positive feedback when they search for keywords to learn more relevant news or knowledge. Weibo management is very strict, and abusive and abusive words are prohibited. This is also a benefit, making the whole community more positive and harmonious.

One of the restrictions of using online tools provided by the employer is that the work environment can be considered repressive by the employees, and this can work towards the damage of employee morale and confidence (Yoakam, 2019). However, the implementation of these tools helps improve the productivity of individuals at the workplace because time is not spent on other platforms.

### Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on?

According to ToS, Weibo is protected by the laws of the People's Republic of China. Anyone spreading rumors on Weibo will be punished by law and restricted by the platform. You can file a lawsuit when you are threatened or treated unfairly on the platform. In order to ensure the safety of each user and trust platform must strictly require each user's rules of use. 

To build a reliable PLN, an individual needs to open a Weibo account that allows the individual to follow and engage educators they admire. The individual may also start blogging their ideas, which helps connect with a broader community of teachers (Arsarkij & Laohajaratsang, 2021). For veteran storytellers to reduce the possibility of sharing misinformation, they should engage teachers of similar topics because they have already researched. The veteran storyteller should also explore current events that are considered hot-button. 

## Avoid Misinformation

Authors usually include a description of the source of the story when they tell it. To avoid the risk of misinformation on Weibo, most people write something at the end of the story to avoid misunderstandings, such as the above story is adapted from a true story or the content of the story contains personal opinions for reference only. Most microbloggers usually talk to viewers in the comments section when they post articles or stories on microblogs, which is one way to avoid misinformation. Another way is to look up certain information from other software or websites before starting the story, and adding the reference at the end.
